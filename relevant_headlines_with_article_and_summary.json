AdvertisementDuring a meeting at the National Academies\u2019 Space Studies Board on Thursday, NASA\u2019s Director of the Mars Exploration Program Eric Ianson unveiled the space agency\u2019s long-term strategy for exploring Mars, titled \u201cExploring Mars Together\u201d that highlighted what\u2019s next after the sample return mission, SpaceNews reported. \u201cWe wanted to look two decades into the future as far as what are the things that we can do to create equally dramatic and profound science [as Mars Sample Return],\u201d Ianson is quoted as saying. \u201cWhat we\u2019re proposing to do here is to do it at lower cost and a higher cadence of missions.\u201d He projected that those low-cost missions would be between $100 million to $300 million each.G/O Media may get a commission42% OffAmazon Fire TV 50\" 4K Smart TVIncredible visualsThis smart TV has access to a wide array of streaming services, all of which are easier to navigate, has 4K visuals for a stunning picture, and comes with an Alexa Voice Remote too. Buy for $260 from AmazonAdvertisementAdvertisementAn illustration of the Mars Sample Return mission.Illustration: NASAShould the proposed draft strategy be accepted as doctrine, it can be said that NASA will end the era of high-end Mars rovers with a bang; it does not get more complex than Mars Sample Return. The mission is a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency, and it includes an orbiter, lander, two helicopters, and a rocket. Working together, this fleet will retrieve rock samples that have been stowed away by the Perseverance rover on Mars.AdvertisementMoving forward, however, the space agency wants to keep it simple. \u201cHistorically we\u2019ve had peaks and valleys in the Mars program,\u201d said Ianson during the meeting, according to SpaceNews. \u201cWhen we talk about sustainable, it\u2019s something that can be constant throughout. We want to try and maintain missions on a regular cadence.\u201dThat is until NASA tries to land humans on Mars for the first time. The space agency is focused on its Moon to Mars objectives, a proposed idea to use the Moon as a testbed to eventually land humans on Mars, including the use of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket for deep space exploration. With the prospect of landing humans on Mars, NASA no longer seems interested in developing increasingly complex robots for the Red Planet. Which actually makes sense. AdvertisementNASA\u2019s rover missions usually came one right after the other. The Curiosity rover, Perseverance\u2019s predecessor, landed on Mars in August 2012 and NASA began developing its Mars 2020 rover mission the following year. But now, the agency\u2019s \u201cFuture\u201d tab on its Mars Exploration website includes a section for the Mars Sample Return mission and another section for \u201cHumans on Mars,\u201d indicating that another signature Mars rover mission is currently not in the books.This could very well be the end of a legendary era for NASA\u2019s Mars exploration program. The robotic Martian explorers have provided some major insights on the history of Mars and the potential for the discovery of ancient microbial life on another planet, plus a few iconic selfies during their journey. I guess a human selfie on Mars could be pretty cool too, but those humans will have some big, robotic shoes to fill.AdvertisementFor more spaceflight in your life, follow us on Twitter and bookmark Gizmodo\u2019s dedicated Spaceflight page.\n\n", "summary": "NASA is proposing a longterm strategy of lower-cost, sustainable missions to Mars once every two years instead of hugely expensive rovers.

About 50 kilometers across the blue water is Zmiinyi (Snake) Island, which two Russian warships attacked at the beginning of the invasion last year. It was during this attack that the now-ubiquitous phrase \u201cRussian warship, go fuck yourself\u201d was first-uttered by border guard Roman Hrybov. Ukraine reclaimed the island in June.WatchRare Polar Bear Attack in Canada | Extreme Earth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoRare Polar Bear Attack in Canada | Extreme EarthForget Collars\u2014There's a Kinder Way to Track Polar Bears in the ArcticFebruary 28, 2023Russian Court Says Meta Is \"Extremist Organization\"March 21, 2022The clean, cold air slaps in waves, straining the tall golden grass along the coastline, while swans and gulls congregate on the calmer waters in the bay. The landscape perfectly resembles the Ukrainian flag. Now, the atmosphere is oddly calm. AdvertisementStaff at Tuzlovski Lagoons National Park take a spindly, faded skeleton down from a high cabinet, as well as three more unmistakably beaked skulls. These are the remains of just a few dolphins of around 100 that have been found dead nearby. \u201cSo far, we estimate the total number as at least 50,000,\u201d says ecologist Ivan Rusev, who is head of research here at the park. While just an estimate, the figure seems to hold water. Over just one 6-kilometer stretch of coastline, Rusev has found 38 dolphins, while some 3,000 dead are recorded in data from other Black Sea countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey). However, he suspects thousands more have simply sunk to the bottom of the sea. Night footage from motion-sensor cameras show local wildlife such as jackals eating their remains, rendering them useless for scientific assessment.G/O Media may get a commission42% OffAmazon Fire TV 50\" 4K Smart TVIncredible visualsThis smart TV has access to a wide array of streaming services, all of which are easier to navigate, has 4K visuals for a stunning picture, and comes with an Alexa Voice Remote too.

(There are three species living in the Black Sea: the Black Sea harbor porpoise, Black Sea bottlenose dolphin, and the short-beaked common dolphin.) They are nervously watching for the numbers to start rising again.\u201cFrom March to October, many dolphins come to this area to feed and to breed,\u201d says Rusev. He has been tracking the corpses washing up along this now-serene stretch of coastline and is monitoring for signs of an impending new spike.AdvertisementDolphin skulls taken from remains that washed ashore along this stretch of coastline near Prymorske, Ukraine.Photo: Aliide NaylorRusev says there are several wartime factors leading to the mass deaths of dolphins in the region: sonar damages their capacity to hunt; they\u2019re suffering burns from the use of phosphorus incendiaries; and they can get embolisms and decompression sickness from the sheer impact of explosions causing them to rise to the surface. Advertisement\u201cThis house that you saw, it is located 50 kilometers from Snake Island,\u201d Rusev says. \u201cIt was trembling from the falling bombs. This is what we felt. And in the water, this feeling is many times stronger, and dolphins, when they are close to the fall of bombs, they automatically simply rise to the surface of the water.\u201dSonar emanating from vessels in the Black Sea is a major issue in terms of the mammals\u2019 hunting capabilities. Because dolphins \u2018see\u2019 with echolocation, the heavy presence of sonar can throw them off course. \u201cThey get acoustically traumatized and become deaf. They cannot see and cannot hear and cannot use echolocation to navigate,\u201d says Rusev. AdvertisementThis phenomenon has been previously documented, specifically when a mass stranding of Cuvier\u2019s beaked whales took place in the Bahamas in the year 2000, during U.S. naval exercises. The government concluded the stranding was the direct result of mid-frequency active sonar use. This is even without considering the very real impact of stress on the animals. \u201cIt was trembling from the falling bombs. This is what we felt. And in the water, this feeling is many times stronger\u201dAdvertisement\u201cThe recovery of dolphin populations will take decades,\u201d Ruslan Strilets, Ukraine\u2019s minister of environmental protection and natural resources, tells Gizmodo. Only partial access to the Black Sea coastline means that figures could be much higher than even Rusev\u2019s estimates. \u201cThe scale of the tragedy along the entire coast of the Black and Azov Seas is difficult to even imagine,\u201d he adds.In Ukrainian-controlled territories, the only protected areas are the Tuzlovski Lagoons and the Danube Biosphere Reserve. \u201cWe do not have access to the rest due to the actions of the Russians, and we are afraid to even imagine the consequences of the occupation,\u201d says Strilets. AdvertisementRussia\u2019s attacks on areas around the park and unusually high levels of naval activity in the Black Sea more generally mean that the local ecology has been suffering tremendously. Along with devastating marine mammal populations, massive, stray S-200 rockets contaminate the land and seabed, and birds inhabiting the region have had their nests destroyed by missiles. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying habitats, they\u2019re destroying a lot of nesting sites, they\u2019re destroying a lot of these places where animals reproduce,\u201d says Jana Asselman, head of the Blue Growth Research Lab at Ghent University. \u201cWhen we\u2019re thinking about larger animals that have a once-a-year reproduction cycle, you might see a long-term impact on the population, and we might see some bird species declining.\u201dAdvertisementA staff member at Tuzlovski Lagoons National Park walks along the Black Sea coast near Prymorske, Ukraine. Numerous dead dolphins have washed ashore here.Photo: Aliide NaylorThe wide-scale environmental impact of war extends much farther than this stretch of coastline. Water levels have been dropping massively in the Kakhovka Reservoir, on southern Ukraine\u2019s Dnieper river, since February this year, harming the local ecology and endangering the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Advertisement\u201cWe may have a second Japanese \u2018Fukushima\u2019 on our territory,\u201d Strilets says. \u201cSpring and warmer temperatures will lead to a deterioration in water quality,[and] the accumulation and spread of toxins,\u201d Strilets adds. \u201cFish are already dying en masse.\u201d\u2018Ecocide\u2019Russia has deliberately targeted oil depots, as well as Ukraine\u2019s nuclear facilities, leading officials to start pursuing ecocide charges. Advertisement\u201cOf course, ecocide is taking place here in Ukraine,\u201d Maxim Popov, from Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office, tells Gizmodo. He says that his office is \u201ccurrently prosecuting 11 criminal cases with that legal qualification,\u201d while more than 100 further criminal proceedings relating to environmental damage as a consequence of war are being investigated. Article 441 of Ukraine\u2019s Criminal Code stipulates that the mass destruction of flora and fauna and the poisoning of air or water resources should result in a prison term of eight to 15 years. The dolphin deaths would very much fall under the banner of \u201cmass destruction of fauna,\u201d says Popov.AdvertisementRussia\u2019s attacks on oil depots comprise the overwhelming majority of the 11 specific ecocide cases. The destruction of just two of them in Kyiv region polluted over 30,000 square meters of land. \u201c[There] was a huge contamination of air as well as the contamination of soil and groundwater, and it directly influenced the health of the people who reside in that area,\u201d adds Popov.\u201cWe may have a second Japanese \u2018Fukushima\u2019 on our territory\u201dAdvertisementResponding to a question about whether he thought Russia\u2019s intent was to cause ecological devastation, he notes that the destruction of oil depots gave Russia no obvious military advantage\u2014and only caused pollution and inconvenience to ordinary civilians. \u201cThe question arises, what was the reason for attacking such a huge quantity of oil storages?\u201d he said. Russia has not exactly held back from making life miserable for ordinary civilians, though. Intended or not, the overall impact is no doubt catastrophic. Some 330,000 hectares of forests have burned over the course of the invasion (deforestation and illegal logging were also issues in the country prior to the war), and 33 million tons of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide equivalent) have been released into the atmosphere as a direct result of Russia\u2019s armed aggression, according to Ukraine\u2019s environment ministry. \u201cWarfare has damaged all types of natural ecosystems (soil, water, air) that are the basis [of existence] for humans as well as other living creatures,\u201d says Yuliia Spinova, co-founder of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group (UNCG), tells Gizmodo. AdvertisementFurther east, out of the protected park area and in a village close to Mykolaiv, old rocket fuel canisters and remnants of cluster bombs are strewn across the area. Russia targeted it with heavy shelling from the beginning of the war, partially destroying a school, among several other buildings. Strategically important, it was seen as a \u2018stepping stone\u2019 to Russian forces taking Odesa. Both at the national park and here near Mykolaiv, waste disposal seems to have been a casualty of the war, too; trash is strewn about the landscape along with the remnants of heavy weaponry. Spinova cites the \u201cabsence of the system of waste collection and disposal at the state level\u201d and overfilled disposal points, while locals suggest that the absence of large vehicle drivers (who may be fighting) and general lack of sorting habits among villagers might contribute to the issue.A view of the Black Sea coastline near Prymorske, Ukraine, where numerous dead dolphins have washed ashore amid the ongoing Russian invasion. Photo: Aliide NaylorAdvertisementThese remnants of months of assaults on the region and many others across Ukraine, as well as heavily mined terrain, may also cause serious environmental damage. Explosives such as TNT can release lead, copper, arsenic, and nitroaromatic metabolites into the environment, according to one study.\u201c174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territories are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. These mined territories are twice the size of Austria,\u201d Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky said in a video address Thursday.Advertisement There remains relatively little research on the long-term impacts of this contamination. \u201cThe problem is we know very little, the long-term effects of these low concentrations,\u201d says Asselman. She adds that explosives like TNT and petrol that end up in the environment are the most harmful, but a less obvious environmental issue could be the casing of incendiary devices, which could release metals into the soil. Soil samples from military training areas have previously been found \u201ccontaminated with various concentrations of heavy metals,\u201d with \u201cmost of the contamination was in soil samples from UXO sites and explosion craters.\u201dThat said, common explosives such as TNT, RDX, and HMX \u201cdon\u2019t tend to bioaccumulate,\u201d Assleman added. \u201cThe only good thing about them is they they dissolve very quickly, which means that if you have a large body of water, the concentrations go from very high to very low very quickly.\u201d AdvertisementMeanwhile, local scientists have been mourning the general dearth of research on the issue. \u201cObserving the impact of hostilities on natural and semi-natural ecosystems and speaking about the assessment of the environmental consequences of the war in Ukraine over the course of nine years, one can generally note with regret the low interest of the scientific community,\u201d Spinova tells Gizmodo.Clean energy? The wider context of the war is also important to consider. EU gas dependency on Russia has historically contributed to western European leaders\u2019 reluctance to deal with Russia too harshly\u2014permitting the continued construction of the now-sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines, against Ukraine and eastern Europe\u2019s wishes. Climate Transparency\u2019s 2022 report noted that fossil fuels comprised 57% of the country\u2019s primary energy supply in 2021 (Russia accounts for around 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the U.S. accounts for around 15%). In 2021, prior to the full-scale invasion, more than 50% of Russia\u2019s crude oil exports went to European nations.Advertisement\u201cIn many ways it has reshaped the entire world\u2019s energy market,\u201d said Angelina Davydova from the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Work Group, in February. \u201cDecarbonization and moving past the use of fossil fuels is an important step on the way to democratization and global security.\u201d Europe has started moving away from dependence on Russian gas and pivoting toward American imports of liquefied natural gas, as well as developing a broader interest in the prospects of nuclear energy. Nationwide power outages in Ukraine have driven public interest and demand for solar power, such as that powering the coastal hut (over the holiday period, the Christmas tree in Kyiv train station was even lit up with the power of cycling). Ukraine is well-placed to pursue these initiatives further: \u201cIt has an incredible industrial base, it has an incredible scientific, academic base,\u201d Sagatom Saha, a researcher at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, recently told Roll Call. \u201cIt has many of the things you look for to build a clean-energy economy.\u201dAdvertisementHowever, some of Ukraine\u2019s own renewable facilities have been damaged by war, and the best potential for wind and solar is in the country\u2019s southern areas, some of which have been or still are occupied by Russia, Artem Semenyshyn, executive director of the Solar Energy Association of Ukraine, told Scientific American. And as Strilets points out, the broader war damage that we are aware of only concerns the territories that Ukraine currently has access to\u2014many of them remain under Russian control. \u201cSuch natural treasures as Askania-Nova, Oleshkivski Sands, Dzharylgach, and others are still under occupation,\u201d wrote Victoria Litvinova, deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine. The long-term impact is still very much to be seen, both at home and abroad. \u201cThe environment has no borders,\u201d she added.
