Cooling those same data centers also makes the AI chatbots incredibly thirsty. New research suggests training for GPT-3 alone consumed 185,000 gallons (700,000 liters) of water. An average user\u2019s conversational exchange with ChatGPT basically amounts to dumping a large bottle of fresh water out on the ground, according to a new study. Given the chatbot\u2019s unprecedented popularity, researchers fear all those spilled bottles could take a troubling toll on water supplies, especially amid historic droughts and looming environmental uncertainty in the US.WatchTop Takeaways from the Apple Event\n\n\n\n\n\nCCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoTop Takeaways from the Apple EventWhy Banning TikTok Won\u2019t Protect Our PrivacyMarch 2, 2023Mac Studio and Studio Display ReviewMarch 18, 2022Researchers from the University of California Riverside and the University of Texas Arlington published the AI water consumption estimates in a pre-print paper titled \u201cMaking AI Less \u2018Thirsty.\u2019\u201d The authors found the amount of clear freshwater required to train GPT-3 is equivalent to the amount needed to fill a nuclear reactor\u2019s cooling tower. OpenAI has not disclosed the length of time required to train GPT-3, complicating the researchers\u2019 estimations, but Microsoft, which has struck a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar partnership with the AI startup and built supercomputers for AI training, says that its latest supercomputer, which would require an extensive cooling apparatus, contains 10,000 graphics cards and over 285,000 processor cores, giving a glimpse into the vast scale of the operation behind artificial intelligence. That huge number of gallons could produce battery cells for 320 Teslas, or, put another way, ChatGPT, which came after GPT-3, would need to \u201cdrink\u201d a 500-milliliter water bottle in order to complete a basic exchange with a user consisting of roughly 25-50 questions.AdvertisementThe gargantuan number of gallons needed to train the AI model also assumes the training is happening in Microsoft\u2019s state-of-the-art US data center, built especially for OpenAI to the tune of tens of millions. If the data was trained in the company\u2019s less energy-efficient Asia data center, the report notes water consumption could be three times higher. The researchers expect these water requirements will only increase further with newer models, like the recently released GPT-4, which rely on a larger set of data parameters than their predecessors. \u201cAI models\u2019 water footprint can no longer stay under the radar,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cWater footprint must be addressed as a priority as part of the collective efforts to combat global water challenges.\u201dAdvertisementAdvertisementHow do chatbots use water?When calculating AI\u2019s water consumption, the researchers draw a distinction between water \u201cwithdrawal\u201d and \u201cconsumption.\u201d The first example is the practice of physically removing water from a river, lake, or other source, while consumption refers specifically to the loss of water by evaporation when it\u2019s used in data centers. The research on AI\u2019s water usage focuses primarily on the consumption part of that equation, where the water can\u2019t be recycled.AdvertisementAnyone who\u2019s spent a few seconds in a company server room knows you need to pack a sweater first. Server rooms are kept cool, typically between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent equipment from malfunctioning. Maintaining that ideal temperature is a constant challenge because the servers themselves convert their electrical energy into heat. Cooling towers like the ones shown below are often deployed to try and counteract that heat and keep the rooms in their ideal temperature by evaporating cold water.Evaporative Cooling Towers in the Data Center ProcessCooling towers get the job done, but they require immense amounts of water to do so. The researchers estimate around a gallon of water is consumed for every kilowatt-hour expended in an average data center. Not just any type of water can be used, either. Data centers pull from clean, freshwater sources in order to avoid the corrosion or bacteria growth that can come with seawater. Freshwater is also essential for humidity control in the rooms. The researchers likewise hold data centers accountable for the water needed to generate the high amounts of electricity they consume, something the scientists called \u201coff-site indirect water consumption.\u201d AdvertisementGoogle data center imagesWater consumption issues aren\u2019t limited to OpenAI or AI models. In 2019, Google requested more than 2.3 billion gallons of water for data centers in just three states. The company currently has 14 data centers spread out across North America which it uses to power Google Search, its suite of workplace products, and more recently, its LaMDa and Bard large language models. LaMDA alone, according to the recent research paper, could require millions of liters of water to train, larger than GPT-3 because several of Google\u2019s thirsty data centers are housed in hot states like Texas; researchers issued a caveat with this estimation, though, calling it an \u201c approximate reference point.\u201dAdvertisementAside from water, new LLMs similarly require a staggering amount of electricity. A Stanford AI report released last week looks at differences in energy consumption among four prominent AI models, estimating OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 released 502 metric tons of carbon during its training. Overall, the energy needed to train GPT-3 could power an average American\u2019s home for hundreds of years.\u201cThe race for data centers to keep up with it all is pretty frantic,\u201d Critical Facilities Efficiency Solution CEO Kevin Kent said in an interview with Time. \u201cThey can\u2019t always make the most environmentally best choices.\u201dAdvertisementClimate change and worsening droughts could amplify concerns over AI\u2019s water usageAlready, the World Economic Forum estimates some 2.2 million US residents lack water and basic indoor plumbing. Another 44 million live with \u201cinadequate\u201d water systems. Researchers fear a combination of climate change and increased US populations will make those figures even worse by the end of the century. By 2071, Stanford estimates nearly half of the country\u2019s 204 freshwater basins will be unable to meet monthly water demands. Many regions could reportedly see their water supplies cut by a third in the next 50 years.AdvertisementRising temperatures partially fueled by human activity have resulted in the American West recording its worst drought in 1,000 years which also threatens freshwater, though recent flooding rains have helped stave off some dire concerns. Water levels at reservoirs like Lake Mead have receded so far that they\u2019ve exposed decades old human remains. All of that means AI\u2019s hefty water demands will likely become a growing point of contention, especially if the tech is embedded into ever more sectors and services. Data requirements for LLMs are only getting larger, which means companies will have to find ways to increase their data centers\u2019 water efficiency. Researchers say there are some relatively clear ways to bring AI\u2019s water price tag down. For starters, where and when AI models are trained matters. Outside temperatures, for example, can affect the amount of water required to cool data centers. AI companies could hypothetically train models at midnight when it\u2019s cooler or in a data center with better water efficiency to cut down on usage. Chatbot users, on the other hand, could opt to engage with the modules during \u201cwater-efficient hours,\u201d much as municipal authorities encourage off-hours dishwasher use. Still, any of those demand-side changes will require greater transparency on the part of tech companies building these models, something the researchers say is in worryingly short supply.Advertisement\u201cWe recommend AI model developers and data center operators be more transparent,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cWhen and where are the AI models trained? What about the AI models trained and/or deployed in third-party colocation data centers or public clouds? Such information will be of great value to the research community and the general public.\u201dWant to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

The leaks, the source of which is still unknown, seem to reveal a broad swath of clandestine information\u2014much of which relates to U.S. and NATO efforts to assist Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia. The document that emerged over the weekend is less directly concerned with the Ukraine conflict itself than it is with the alarming digital powers possessed by Russia and its cyber mercenaries.AdvertisementThe leaked briefing seems to detail intercepted communications between a \u201cpro-Russian hacker group\u201d and an agent of the Federal Security Service, or FSB\u2014Russia\u2019s top intelligence agency, the New York Times initially reported.The group in question, known as \u201cZarya,\u201d is reputed to be an offshoot of \u201cKillnet\u201d\u2014the prominent pro-Russian hacktivist group that has been known to target U.S. websites and organizations.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe communications  seem to show that Zarya had infiltrated an unnamed Canadian energy company and that the agent had given the hackers instructions about what to do with their access to the gas company\u2019s network.  In their chats, the hackers claim the frightening ability to remotely manipulate the unnamed energy project\u2019s industrial controls\u2014including a capacity to \u201cincrease valve pressure, disable alarms, and initiate an emergency shutdown of the facility.\u201dEven more disturbingly, the FSB officer  communicated to the hacker group that \u201ca successful operation [against the facility] would cause an explosion\u201d and that the FSB was \u201cmonitoring Canadian news reports for indications of an explosion,\u201d cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter  reported. The goal of this supposed operation was to cause a \u201closs of income for Canadians,\u201d not a \u201closs of life,\u201d the report states.AdvertisementUnfortunately, the available reporting does not state which specific company is said to have been targeted, merely referring to it as an \u201cunspecified gas distribution station.\u201dIt\u2019s also unclear whether anything ever happened with this alleged hacking mission\u2014or if the hackers ultimately managed to damage the company in question.

In this replay session, the researchers gave a ChatGPT Sim named Isabelle the idea that it wants to plan a Valentine\u2019s Day party. It starts off early on a Monday morning, with early risers getting up to brush their teeth and do yoga, while others sleep in. As the 25 generative agents go about their days, they invite one another, make new friends, ask each other out on dates, and even plan what time they\u2019ll arrive at the party together.You can click around to check the status of individual agents, which lets you see what memories they\u2019ve stored, who they\u2019re talking to, and what they\u2019re doing.AdvertisementIf you watch through to the end, you\u2019ll find that five out of 12 people invited to the party show up. Three don\u2019t come because they have scheduling conflicts (Think about how weird that is. They don\u2019t really exist), while four who said they wanted to come don\u2019t show up.The generative agents really do seem to communicate with each other. When the researchers gave a Sim named Sam the goal of running for mayor, (they all live in a town called Smallville, by the way) he went around announcing his candidacy to his neighbors.Advertisement\u201cDuring the two-day simulation, the agents who knew about Sam\u2019s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4 percent) to eight (32 percent), and the agents who knew about Isabella\u2019s party increased from one (4 percent) to twelve (48 percent), completely without user intervention,\u201d the researchers said.As if the fact that this thing exists in the first place isn\u2019t enough, the study deals with questions of actual scientific value.AdvertisementMaking a computer play computer games is nothing new, and the current generation of AI chatbots often whip up distinct personalities as you interact with them. But in order to get a tool like ChatGPT to perform a task that\u2019s useful, you need to establish a framework around it.This isn\u2019t the first time computer scientists used AI to simulate conversations or play games. Researchers trained AI tools to beat chess grandmasters or overcome world champions at video games like StarCraft. And as far back as 1966, the famous 1966 robot therapist Eliza fooled people into thinking they were talking to a real shrink.AdvertisementThis new study builds on that research by going beyond its restraints. Unlike their predecessors, the generative agents in this experiment weren\u2019t spitting out pre written answers or playing games with winners, losers, and clearly defined rules. \u201cThese approaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent behavior to make the effort more manageable,\u201d the researchers said in the paper.Because generative agents interact with their environments and maintain their own \u201cpersonalities\u201d the study demonstrates a model that could be more useful in real world applications.AdvertisementOn the other hand, the agents demonstrate an unnerving level of autonomy. The weird little guys understood what you\u2019re supposed to do in spaces labeled \u201cstore\u201d or \u201cbathroom,\u201d for example. In other words, you can look forward to an internet populated by robots that really seem like their own people, wandering around using apps and websites. Yay!The good news is if you\u2019ve ever felt guilty about all those hours you spent torturing your Sims or trying to get them to have \u201cWooHoo,\u201d now you can pretend you\u2019re doing serious academic research.AdvertisementWant to know more about AI, chatbots, and the future of machine learning?

A few weeks ago, a bug was discovered that exposed chat titles, the first message of new conversations, and payment information from ChatGPT Plus users. OpenAI has also been under intense scrutiny for how it protects user data, especially when it comes to minors. ChatGPT was banned in Italy for this very reason. These issues, plus an open letter signed by Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak and Elon Musk calling for a six-month pause on AI systems, seem to have prompted OpenAI to publicly assert its commitment to safety. The bug bounty program is managed by Bugcrowd(opens in a new tab) which will handle the submissions and rewards. The monetary amount of the reward is based on the severity of the bug. But don't get too excited yet. There are lengthy guidelines and rules of engagement for what won't be rewarded. Jailbreaks, \"getting the model to say bad things to you,\" and hallucinations are explicitly out of scope. Also don't try any attacks that may \"degrade, disrupt, or negatively impact services or user experience\" like a Denial of Service attack (DDoS) or scams like social engineering or phishing. \n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\nWhoops, Samsung workers accidentally leaked trade secrets via ChatGPT\nChatGPT banned in Italy\nChatGPT plugins: How to get access\nNonprofit files FTC complaint against OpenAI's GPT-4\nAmidst controversies, OpenAI insists safety is mission critical\n\n\nAt the time of publication, four vulnerabilities have already been rewarded.

John Fetterman has been discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where he was being treated for depression, his office announced Friday. \n  \n\n      He will return to the Senate when it returns from recess on April 17, his office said in a news release, confirming CNN\u2019s earlier reporting. \n  \n\n      \u201cI am so happy to be home,\u201d the freshman Democrat said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be the father and husband I want to be, and the senator Pennsylvania deserves. Pennsylvanians have always had my back, and I will always have theirs.\u201d \n  \n\n      Fetterman checked himself in last month \u201cto receive treatment for clinical depression,\u201d his chief of staff said at the time. A source familiar with the matter previously told CNN that while Fetterman was not suicidal, his symptoms for depression included loss of weight and loss of appetite. \n  \n\n      \u201cI want everyone to know that depression is treatable, and treatment works,\u201d Fetterman added in the statement after being discharged. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics \u2013 right now there are people who are suffering with depression in red counties and blue counties. \n  \n\n      \u201cIf you need help, please get help,\u201d he said. \n  \n\n      Fetterman, the 53-year-old freshman who helped cement Democrats\u2019 51-49 Senate majority last fall, suffered a stroke last year during the days ahead of the primary. And when he returned to the campaign trail, Fetterman often struggled to communicate with lingering auditory processing issues, relying on assistance through devices with closed captioning in order to properly have conversations and answer questions.\n  \n\n      The same auditory processing issues impacted him in his early days in the Senate. And when he struggled with substantial weight loss and a loss of appetite, he was diagnosed with clinical depression, later checking himself into Walter Reed for treatment.\n  \n\n      Fetterman has experienced depression \u201coff and on\u201d over the course of his life, a statement previously issued by the senator\u2019s chief of staff said.\n  \n\n      In February, the senator went to the George Washington University Hospital after feeling lightheaded, his office announced. However, he was discharged two days later, and his office said that test results had been able to \u201crule out a new stroke.\u201d\n  \n\n      His lack of eating and drinking contributed to dizziness, the source previously told CNN. \n  \n\nEditor\u2019s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or visit the hotline\u2019s website.\n\n\n  CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Clare Foran and Jessica Dean contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

But ChatGPT is blurring the lines of communication.Photo-illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe technology behind ChatGPT has been around for several years without drawing much notice. It was the addition of a chatbot interface that made it so popular. In other words, it wasn\u2019t a development in AI per se but a change in how the AI interacted with people that captured the world\u2019s attention.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.Very quickly, people started thinking about ChatGPT as an autonomous social entity. This is not surprising. As early as 1996, Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass looked at the personal computers of their time and\u00a0found that \u201cequating mediated and real life is neither rare nor unreasonable. It is very common, it is easy to foster, it does not depend on fancy media equipment, and thinking will not make it go away.\u201d\u00a0In other words, people\u2019s fundamental expectation from technology is that it behaves and interacts like a human being, even when they know it is \u201conly a computer.\u201d Sherry Turkle, an MIT professor who has studied AI agents and robots since the 1990s,\u00a0stresses the same point and claims that lifelike forms of communication, such as body language and verbal cues, \u201cpush our Darwinian buttons\u201d\u2014they have the ability to make us experience technology as social, even if we understand rationally that it is not.If these scholars saw the social potential\u2014and risk\u2014in decades-old computer interfaces, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that ChatGPT can also have a similar, and probably stronger, effect. It uses first-person language, retains context, and provides answers in a compelling, confident, and conversational style. Bing\u2019s implementation of ChatGPT even uses emojis. This is quite a step up on the social ladder from the more technical output one would get from searching, say, Google.\u00a0Critics of ChatGPT have focused on the\u00a0harms that its outputs can cause, like misinformation and hateful content. But there are also risks in the mere choice of a social conversational style and in the AI\u2019s attempt to emulate people as closely as possible.\u00a0The Risks of Social InterfacesNew York Times reporter Kevin Roose got caught up in a\u00a0two-hour conversation with Bing\u2019s chatbot that ended in the chatbot\u2019s declaration of love, even though Roose repeatedly asked it to stop. This kind of emotional manipulation would be even more harmful for vulnerable groups, such as teenagers or people who have experienced harassment. This can be highly disturbing for the user, and using human terminology and emotion signals, like emojis, is also a\u00a0form of emotional deception. A language model like ChatGPT does not have emotions. It does not laugh or cry. It actually doesn\u2019t even understand the meaning of such actions.Emotional deception in AI agents is not only morally problematic; their design, which resembles humans, can also make such agents more persuasive. Technology that acts in humanlike ways is likely to persuade people to act, even when\u00a0requests are irrational, made by a faulty AI agent, and\u00a0in emergency situations. Their persuasiveness is dangerous because companies can use them in a way that is unwanted or even unknown to users, from convincing them to buy products to influencing their political views.As a result, some have taken a step back. Robot design researchers, for example,\u00a0have promoted a non-humanlike approach as a way to lower people\u2019s expectations for social interaction. They suggest alternative designs that do not replicate people\u2019s ways of interacting, thus setting more appropriate expectations from a piece of technology.\u00a0Defining Rules\u00a0Some of the risks of social interactions with chatbots can be addressed by designing clear social roles and boundaries for them. Humans choose and switch roles all the time. The same person can move back and forth between their roles as parent, employee, or sibling. Based on the switch from one role to another, the context and the expected boundaries of interaction change too. You wouldn\u2019t use the same language when talking to your child as you would in chatting with a coworker.In contrast, ChatGPT exists in a social vacuum. Although there are some red lines it tries not to cross, it doesn\u2019t have a clear social role or expertise. It doesn\u2019t have a specific goal or a predefined intent, either. Perhaps this was a conscious choice by OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, to promote a multitude of uses or a do-it-all entity. More likely, it was just a lack of understanding of the social reach of conversational agents. Whatever the reason, this open-endedness sets the stage for extreme and risky interactions. Conversation could go any route, and the AI could take on any social role, from\u00a0efficient email assistant to\u00a0obsessive lover.Most PopularGearWhy We Don\u2019t Recommend Ring CamerasAdrienne SoGearWIRED\u2019s Favorite \u2018Buy It for Life\u2019 GearParker HallCultureAfter Threads, There Has to Be a \u2018New Twitter\u2019 MoratoriumKate KnibbsGearThe Best Early Prime Day DealsLouryn StrampeMy own research has shown the importance of clear social roles and boundaries for social AI. For example, in\u00a0a study with my colleague Samantha Reig, we found that AI agents that tried to fill multiple roles that were vastly different from each other (say, providing users with a beauty service and later giving them health advice) lowered people\u2019s trust in the system and made them skeptical of its reliability.\u00a0In contrast, by studying families with teenagers that used conversational AI, we found that the AI agent needs to\u00a0clearly communicate its affiliation\u2014who does the agent answer to, the teenager or the parents?\u2014in order to gain the trust of users and be useful to them. When families didn\u2019t have that information, they found it difficult to anticipate how the system would act and were less likely to give the AI agent personal information. For example, teenagers were concerned that agents would share more with their parents than they would have liked, which made them more hesitant to use it. Having an AI agent\u2019s role clearly defined as affiliated with the teen, and not their parents, would make the technology more predictable and trustworthy.\u00a0Assigning a social role to an AI agent is a useful way to think about designing interactions with a chatbot, and it would help overcome some of these issues. If a child has an AI tutor, its language model should align with this role. Specific boundaries could be defined by the educator, who would adjust them to educational goals and classroom norms. For instance, the tutor may be allowed to ask guiding questions but not give answers; it could provide assistance with improper grammar but not write entire texts. The focus of conversation would be on the educational material and would avoid profanities, politics, and sexual language.\u00a0But if the agent was in a confidant role for this child, we might expect different guardrails. The constraints might be more broadly defined, giving more responsibility to the child. Perhaps there would be more room for playful interactions and responses. Still, some boundaries should be set around age-appropriate language and content, and guarding the child\u2019s physical and mental health. Social contexts are also not limited to one-human/one-agent interactions.\u00a0Once we acknowledge that agents need social roles and boundaries, we need to accept that AI enters a complex social fabric in which multiple stakeholders can have diverging and even conflicting values. In the AI tutor example, the goals of the educator may be different from those of the child, their parents, or the school\u2019s principal. The educator may want the student to get stuck in a productive way, while the parents may prioritize high performance. The principal, on the other hand, might be more concerned with average class outcomes and tutor costs. This kind of constraint-centered thinking is not just about limiting the system, it is also about guiding the user. Knowing an AI\u2019s social role and context can shape user expectations and impact the types of questions and requests raised to the AI in the first place. Therefore, having boundaries on expectations too can help set the stage for safer and more productive interactions.\u00a0A Path ForwardHow can companies begin to adopt social constraints in the design of AI agents? One small example is a feature that OpenAI introduced when launching GPT4. The new demo has a \u201cSystem\u201d input field in its interface, giving users an option to add high-level guides and context into the conversation\u2014or as this article suggests, a social role and interaction boundaries. This is a good start but not enough, as OpenAI is not transparent about how that input changes the AI\u2019s responses. Also, the System field is not necessarily concerned with the social aspects of the AI\u2019s\u00a0 role in interactions with users.A well-defined social context can help structure the social boundaries that we are interested in as a society. It can help companies provide a clear framing of what their AI is designed for, and avoid roles that we deem inappropriate or harmful for AI to fill. It can also allow researchers and auditors to keep track of how conversational technology is being used, and the risks it poses, including those we may not be aware of yet. Without these constraints and with a thoughtless attempt to create an omniscient AI without a specific social role, its effects can quickly spiral out of control.Get More From WIRED\ud83d\udce9 Don\u2019t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day\ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice FutureThe night 17 million military records went up in smokeThe AI protest group campaigning against human extinctionHow your new car tracks youA grid collapse would make a heat wave far deadlierWIRED\u2019s favorite \u201cbuy it for life\u201d gear\ud83c\udf32 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binocularsDr. Michal Luria is a researcher at the Center for Democracy & Technology.
