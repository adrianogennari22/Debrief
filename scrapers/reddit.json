            "description": "I am a CS major, and I am a freshman. I don't have *any* extracurriculars from high school, and since I was diagnosed with a chronic illness at the beginning of the year I wasn't able to focus too well on school, so I couldn't do well at school or have time for extracurriculars or work experience\n\nI don't have any internships for this summer, but I was looking to actually get one for the summer between sophomore and junior year. I'm better now, so I really want to lock in and learn a LOT so I can do interesting projects that I can put on a resume.\n\nI constructed a pathway for myself to follow, but I wanted others' advice on what I'm using to learn.   I tried to choose a general-purpose language and a scripting language, so I chose C++ because I heard it is way easier to learn any other language after you learn C++, and I chose Python because it's simply the most popular and I heard it's the most used in interviews.  I have a strict deadline of perhaps mid-August so I can start doing projects as SOON as possible so I can apply early, so that's basically four months between now and then. But here was my plan:\n\nFrom now until the end of May:\n\n1. Complete CS50 and Learncpp.com and freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing Python Certificate in about 31 days.\n2. Go through Grokking's Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava in 22 days.\n\nFrom the beginning of June until August (all items will be worked on at the same time:\n\n1. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) for learning Data Structures\n2. freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python in 24 days.\n3. MIT Missing Semester\n\nI'm not sure if these resources were all enough for me to consider applying. I'm not even sure if these are *good* resources, because I feel like every time I want to find a good resource to learn something there's one group of people who'll say this is good and another group who'll say this resource is absolutely terrible. Some of these I got from [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)'s FAQ and some are from posts in that subreddit as well.\n\nBut I would like to hear your thoughts on the resources I chose.",

            "title": "Guide for how to get an internship and fix your resume - how to be a competitive applicant. (I have had offers from Tesla, SpaceX, Apple, Microsoft, and more)",
            "description": "TLDR, your resume is THE most important thing. Do something cool then make sure you portray it and yourself in a way that makes an employer want to hire you. \n\n\nOdds are, your resume needs fixing. If you’ve applied to hundreds of openings and still don’t have an internship or job - I hope this guide can help you. \n\nUsing websites and tools I’ve linked below will get you very far with tailoring your resume to play the game of job applications. Most resumes aren't read by a real person until they pass through the automated systems. In addition, often the first person to see your resume may be non-technical so be sure to make things easy to understand. Don't go too in-depth. Having lots of numbers/figures will catch anyone's attention because everyone can understand these metrics. (Improved efficiency by 80%, cut costs by X%, saved the company $$$, etc, etc)\n\n\nThe best thing you can do to get started is read the wiki on r/engineeringresumes, then read many top posts on there, then post an anonymized copy of your own resume. You need to get some brutal and constructive criticism on your resume first.\n\n\nHere are references and tools I use:\n\nhttps://www.jobalytics.co/\n\nhttps://resumeworded.com/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Engineeringresumes\n\n\nFor refining the keywords on my resume, jobalytics is probably my favorite.\n\n\nDownload the chrome extension, then make a word doc, or somewhere else you can start storing notes.\n\n\nUpload your resume to the chrome extension, then go to LinkedIn and start searching for jobs you are interested in. Click on a listing, then use the chrome extension and have it tell you \"Words you are missing in your resume” copy and paste this list of ~10-15 words the word doc. Repeat this for ~10 job listings or so - continue to paste the missing words into a word doc.\n\n\nAfter you have all of these words that you are missing, start looking for common trends in the words, or think about what words you can work on implementing into your resume.\nTry to implement as many words as possible into your resume. \n\n\nAfter you are done, reupload your resume to the Chrome extension, and start looking at ~5-10 job postings again for keywords you are missing.\n\n\nRepeat this until you are not missing many words. A good resume with metrics and meeting the keyword requirements is probably the most important thing to getting an interview. Getting past the automated screening is difficult with how many job applicants there are.\n\n\nOnce you have an interview: prep for it by going over all of the common questions that a company may ask: https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/index.html\n\n\nOn my resume, employers are always interested to hear about my 3D printing business / webtool I developed that has thousands of users. Being able to take an idea to production says a lot about a person. In addition, my internship and other work experience has allowed me to gain a lot of practical engineering knowledge outside of the classroom. They also loved seeing that I was active in an engineering club in my first semester of college. \n\n\nCompanies are also always excited to see FSAE experience, solar car experience, rocket club experience, etc. Many students graduate with no experience, so the people working in these engineering clubs are at a major advantage as they’ve been doing actual engineering since their first semester of university. If your university has an engineering club that actually builds something, hardware or software, - join it asap and commit to working as many hours with it if you can. Your career prospects will thank you. \n\n\nAfter you get to the interview, someone thinks that you are qualified enough to have the position so they're going to primarily be seeing how you are at communicating, how you would react to problematic scenarios, how you would approach a problem, etc. Your resume, projects, etc will show that you have the technical knowledge and can apply it, but a business and internship need you to work on a team so they are testing you as a person.\n\n\nI got my sophomore year internship at Tesla from an employee referral (another intern). Someone I had worked with in a project class during my first year of university. Knowing people and reaching out to alumni from your university at companies will get you very far. I know that there are more qualified people than me out there, but I may have never applied to this position if I hadn’t been referred. Networking is important.\n\n\nAfter your resume is good, the rest is a numbers game. Depending on the economy, your previous experiences, etc, you may need to apply for 400+ internships. This is a numbers game - spend several hours per day applying to a wide variety of companies (especially if this is your first internship or job) \n\n\nBonus tip: I’ve found that co-ops (6+ month internships) are easier to get as there are fewer students applying for them. Apply to them as a moonshot - if you get the offer, figure out what taking a semester off will do to your graduation schedule. Remember you can always take college courses online from many different universities during the school year, or over the summer. UND, ASU, UW Madison, etc, all offer lots of online engineering courses over the summer/some during the year.\n\nThat’s all. Let me know if you have any questions.",

I  am a senior and had to retake the class this semester, which I chose to  take with another professor hoping I would have a better experience  with the class.\n\nThe first midterm I  scored a 45 but did not notice the negative grade penalties he was  using at the time. For the 2nd midterm I studied my ass off and made a  31 which was very alarming. When I checked gradescope to see why I made  such a low grade, I saw that for every single question I answered  incorrectly, he docked my exam grade the total number of points that  question was worth instead of just giving no credit for incorrect  answers.\n\nOn the choose all that  apply questions, he docked my exam grade the total number of points the  question was worth PER incorrect selected answer (so if I selected 2-3  wrong on selected all that apply, grade was docked total amount that  question was worth x how many answers on that specific questions I  selected incorrectly).\n\nWhen I sent  him an email this morning about it to get more clarification on the  negative grade penalties, his response was \"the negative penalties are  mentioned on the first page of the exam instructions\" instead of hearing  any of my concerns on this practice. I have NEVER taken a CS course or  any course at my university where we were docked negative points for  each incorrect answer from our grade. I went to the advising office and  they were in agreement it sounded extremely unfair but that their hands  were tied.\n\nI only have 2 terms in  residence left and this class is not offered over the summer so this is  my last chance to take it and be on track to graduate in my program  since I can not do more than 2 semesters, which I need for the last core  CS class (pretty much everyone I've talked to about it underloads while  taking it) and 4 upper level CS electives with 2 in the fall and 2 in  the spring in case I have to retake the final core CS class in my final  semester.\n\nI will be 29 years old  when I graduate next spring and if I don't make at least a C in this  class I can't take any of the classes I need to take to graduate at all  and would be taking random classes in the fall with only 1 semester left  after that. I am 27k in debt for this program with no savings and have  heard horror stories about people dropping out, doing a bootcamp, and  being unable to find work for a year or longer. Graduating from this  program is my last hope especially with how competitive the job market  is right now for SWE and dev jobs. Let me know what you would do if this  were the case for you.",

            "description": " Hello!\n\nI'm a CS major who's going to graduate with a BS in June. I've been focused on taking courses and doing work in ML throughout my undergraduate years , as I want to eventually do applied ML work in industry in the future. I did a bit of research on how to get this position, and the general consensus seems to be that a Masters/PhD is required for the job.\n\nI applied to several Masters programs in ML/AI a few months ago, and, although I'm still waiting on a few more results, I've been rejected to the majority of them, so it seems I'll need to go into industry and try reapplying in the future. However, it doesn't seem like I can get an ML job (because of the restrictions I mentioned above), and because I've been focusing on ML, my skills in other CS fields (data structures, databases, servers, etc.) are pretty lacking. Coupled with the fact that the news has been talking about layoffs in the tech industry recently, I'm pretty worried about my future and what it holds.\n\nShould I start focusing on some non-ML field, and try to improve my skills in that field as fast as possible, so I can get a job there? I'm not sure how this would make me a better candidate if I do end up reapplying for a ML Masters program though. What are the best steps that I can take in my position if I eventually want to do applied ML in industry?\n\nThank you in advance for any advice!",

Currently I'm debating between Purdue and Michigan-Dearborn (for a possible transfer to Michigan-Ann Arbor). \n\nI think ultimately, I want to do something related to cyber security or engineering. \n\nI heard Purdue CS has a high ranking, so I don't know if a transfer is worth it. Yet if I choose UM-Dearborn, I'm definitely going to try to transfer. If I choose Purdue though, I might try to transfer to UM school of engineering. \n\nI don't know anything of the transferring process yet, like the transfer of credits, or how hard it would be for each option.\n\nIf anyone has any advice that would be appreciated!",

            "description": "So my university’s course schedule for the fall semester is out. Although I’m not registering yet (I have to get my summer semester out of the way), I was taking a look anyways. I noticed that 3/5 of the classes I have to take are all on the same days. The remaining two, I can do whatever I want with them. \n\nI was talking to my parents about this and they BOTH suggested that I stack my classes so that I’ll have a longer weekend and more days off (to study lol). Honestly I thought this was a crazy idea at first because I’ll be so exhausted. It’ll probably be 8am-2pm of classes straight with no breaks in between and then an online class sometime later in the day. But now I’m not sure? It would be useful to have some extra days off. \n\nHas anyone else done this/knows someone who’s done this, and can speak from experience?",

I'm leaning towards accepting the new grad position, but am concerned about future job prospects. I've heard that defense companies use antiquated tech stacks which might hinder getting future jobs. Will taking a job in defense limit my ability to get better jobs 1-2 years down the line? \n\nThe benefit of the new grad role is its decent pay (compared to other offers I've gotten) and is in a place I want to live in. I'll also get to work with C++/Linux which I prefer to web dev jobs involving C#/JavaScript/Windows.",
