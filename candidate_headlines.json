For the women who'd prefer to gather crumbs of someone's vibe before meeting in person, online dating's shift to video dating in 2020 could prove comforting. It goes without saying that you're never required to meet up with a match in person immediately, but it'd be nice not to be pestered about it.The communication skills gained through hashing out COVID-related issues aren't for nothing, either. People have gotten comfortable with bringing up personal boundaries and bonding over universal anxieties with someone they met on a dating app \\u2014 both of which could benefit women online. Tinder thinks the honesty will carry over when things are back to normal, and hopefully the assholes will continue to weed themselves out. What are the best dating sites for women?Here are the best dating sites and apps for single women looking for a date, a movie buddy, a friend with benefits, or a romantic commitment.\\xa0", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-women", "pubDate": "Mon, 10 Apr 2023 15:45:04 +0000", "feed_title": "Mashable", "feed_link": "null"}, {"id_field": "128212e3-f6ed-4e4e-af82-62ee3ecb151c", "embed_text": "'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for April 11 - If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints.

Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users.

But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations.

The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters.

Quite the opposite, possibly. Rather than ripping stars to shreds and swallowing up every morsel, this black hole is believed to be fostering new star formation, leaving a trail of newborn stars stretching 200,000 light-years through space. Pieter van Dokkum, an astronomy professor at Yale University, said as the black hole rams into gas, it seems to trigger a narrow corridor of new stars, where the gas has a chance to cool. How exactly it works, though, isn't known, said van Dokkum, who led research on the phenomenon captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope accidentally.

The process of pairing your AirPods via Bluetooth might look different depending on what type of computer you use. Let's go with a Mac first. How to connect AirPods to a MacFirst you want to make sure that your Mac's operating system is up to date. To do that, click on the Apple icon in the upper left hand corner of your desktop screen and click on \"About this Mac.\" A screen will pop up, and there you can click on \"Software Update.\" According to Apple, regular, 2nd generation AirPods require macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, and AirPods Pro require Catalina 10.15.1 or later.Now that you've made sure your mac is up to date with the latest software, follow these simple steps to connect your AirPods. 1. Open System Preferences If you can't find it, it's the icon on your desktop that looks like a gear.
