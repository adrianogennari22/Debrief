While it\\u2019s exciting to take in new sights and cultures, you also have to think about the more boring parts of travel. Making sure you have access to data is important to stay connected with friends and family back home and to keep yourself safe in an unfamiliar place. You can get an eSIM card and $50 of data credit to use on trips to over 120 countries for just $19.97 (reg. $50) through April 3.A simple way to connect while travelingAn eSIM is essentially mobile data that connects to networks in other countries without racking up any roaming charges. AloSIM gives you lifetime access to the eSIM card and $50 worth of data to load onto your phone, tablet, or computer. Here\\u2019s how it works:Purchase and install the eSIM on your chosen device before heading to the airport.Search for your travel destination.\\xa0Select a data package that best suits your needs and purchase with your credits. For example, you may choose a seven-day 1GB plan for $5 or all the way up to a 30-day 10GB plan for $22.50.Use your data to talk, text, and browse during your trip.\\xa0Once your data pack is activated, use your device just like you would back home. Browse the web to find great bakeries in France or entertainment spots in Germany. You may also use it to get directions to your hotel before you even leave the airport.Note that once you activate a data package for use, it will expire within the specified time. You can repurchase additional data for your eSIM at any time.One less thing to do\\xa0Years ago, you would\\u2019ve had to purchase a physical SIM card from your mobile carrier. There\\u2019s no telling what that could cost you, how long it may last, and don\\u2019t forget the annoyance of yet another errand to run before traveling. eSIMs are convenient because they allow you to purchase, install, and upgrade them at any time.
