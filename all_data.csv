An internal staff email leaked to the outlet shared that the Joe Biden administration sees this change on Twitter as diminishing the value of the blue verification badge.""It is our understanding that Twitter Blue does not provide person-level verification as a service. Thus, a blue check mark will now simply serve as a verification that the account is a paid user,"" said White House director of digital strategy Rob Flaherty in that email.Although, it does appear that official government accounts like the @WhiteHouse handle and @JoeBiden will still have the grey verification badge that Musk rolled out to denote a ""government"" account. These badges do not cost those users any money.Major news outlets also shared that they would not be purchasing Twitter Blue at the organization level or for individuals journalists and staffers. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, POLITICO, Vox, and BuzzFeed all shared statements declaring that they would not be paying for Twitter Blue. Each outlet said how the service changes the meaning of the badge and no longer designates an actually verified user on the platform.Actor Karl Urban chimed in on the matter as well, saying he's not paying for the Twitter Blue service.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n""Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019ll loose the blue tick on Saturday,"" Urban tweeted.

After losing half of Twitter's biggest advertisers when he acquired the platform, Musk rolled out the paid Twitter Blue subscription service. For just $8, anyone could be verified. However, that anyone included numerous accounts impersonating big brand names and companies. Soon after launch, Twitter had to pause the program due to these troll accounts.Twitter Blue was relaunched earlier this year, but it's not been very successful. Less than 500,000 users out of Twitter's 254 million daily active users pay for the service. Recent data on the program found that around half of all those paying were accounts with less than 1,000 followers. And recent screenshots indicate that Twitter is worried that the paid verification badge is becoming a mark of shame, as the company tests out options to allow paying users to hide it.",Twitter's biggest users say they won't be paying for Twitter Blue checkmarks,"By the time you're reading this, Twitter may or may not have already removed the blue checkmarks from its legacy verified users.

What is this-the Colombia Records & Tape Club?\U0001f644""And it's not just professional athletes and Hollywood actors sharing this sentiment either.According to Axios, The White House will also not be paying for Twitter Blue subscriptions. An internal staff email leaked to the outlet shared that the Joe Biden administration sees this change on Twitter as diminishing the value of the blue verification badge.""It is our understanding that Twitter Blue does not provide person-level verification as a service. Thus, a blue check mark will now simply serve as a verification that the account is a paid user,"" said White House director of digital strategy Rob Flaherty in that email.Although, it does appear that official government accounts like the @WhiteHouse handle and @JoeBiden will still have the grey verification badge that Musk rolled out to denote a ""government"" account. These badges do not cost those users any money.Major news outlets also shared that they would not be purchasing Twitter Blue at the organization level or for individuals journalists and staffers. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, POLITICO, Vox, and BuzzFeed all shared statements declaring that they would not be paying for Twitter Blue. Each outlet said how the service changes the meaning of the badge and no longer designates an actually verified user on the platform.Actor Karl Urban chimed in on the matter as well, saying he's not paying for the Twitter Blue service.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n""Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019ll loose the blue tick on Saturday,"" Urban tweeted. ""I\u2019m opposed to spending money on social media. I\u2019ll go checkless. Please be careful of Imposters & money soliciting scams. I will never ask you for money on any social media platform.""Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame not only said he wouldn't be paying for the blue checkmark, but he indicated that he would no longer be using the platform either.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n""Friends, there are bigger issues in the \U0001f30ethan the blue verified \u2714\ufe0fnext to my name on this account,"" Alexander tweeted. ""But without it, anyone can allege to be me. So, if I lose that \u2714\ufe0f know I will leave this platform. Anyone appearing with it=an imposter. I tell you this while I\u2019m still official.""\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nNumerous NFL players like Patrick Maholmes, Michael Thomas, and Darius Slay tweeted that they would not pay for the checkmark as well.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, Twitter initially rolled out the free verification service in 2009 after it was sued by former St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa after an account on the platform had impersonated him.However, Musk has displayed his disdain for the verification program ever since taking the company over. After losing half of Twitter's biggest advertisers when he acquired the platform, Musk rolled out the paid Twitter Blue subscription service. For just $8, anyone could be verified. However, that anyone included numerous accounts impersonating big brand names and companies. Soon after launch, Twitter had to pause the program due to these troll accounts.Twitter Blue was relaunched earlier this year, but it's not been very successful. Less than 500,000 users out of Twitter's 254 million daily active users pay for the service. Recent data on the program found that around half of all those paying were accounts with less than 1,000 followers. And recent screenshots indicate that Twitter is worried that the paid verification badge is becoming a mark of shame, as the company tests out options to allow paying users to hide it.",https://mashable.com/article/twitter-celebrities-no-thanks-twitter-blue,"Sat, 01 Apr 2023 10:00:00 +0000",Mashable,

And people are feeling that now: 25 percent of respondents in the Bumble BFF survey said they're stuck in outdated friendships that no longer serve them, while 68 percent said they're a different person now compared to the person they were when they met their best friends/closest friends.\xa0\n    'Friendship pruning' is very common as many of us go through new stages of life. \n    \n""We can outgrow friendships and stay too long out of loyalty or history,"" said licensed psychotherapist and author of Boundary Boss, Terri Cole, ""but it is your job to be discerning about who gets the privilege of being in the VIP section of your amazing life.""Only you can make the decision to end a friendship. Jackson laid out some questions to ask yourself when identifying a potentially friendship-ending conflict:\xa0Is this a conflict that you are willing to compromise on?\xa0Do these conflicts happen more often than not?\xa0Do the conflicts become more hurtful over time?\xa0\n    It is your job to be discerning about who gets the privilege of being in the VIP section of your amazing life.\n    \n""If the troubles of the friendship outweigh the overall value that it adds to your life,"" she added, ""it might be time to end that friendship.""Cole also offered questions to ask about the friend themself:Can I trust them?Do I respect them?Do we bring out the best in each other?\xa0Does this friendship energize or deplete me most of the time?\xa0Do they care about and respect me?\xa0""If you can answer yes to the questions above and they energize you more than they deplete you, then the friendship is adding value to your life,"" Cole said. ""If you answered no to more than a few you might need to work on your communication and boundary setting.""If you're in the latter camp, Cole recommends reflecting on how honest you are with your friend about your preferences, limits, and deal-breakers \u2014 meaning, your boundaries. If you already set regular boundaries and your friend doesn't honor them, it's time to have a conversation to share your frustrations.""If the person is toxic or the relationship regularly causes you anxiety, frustration and suffering \u2014 it is time to cut them [loose],"" said Cole.\xa0The word ""toxic"" is thrown around a lot these days, but it's true that some people just don't serve you. Signs of a toxicity could be feeling drained after spending time together, or feeling like you're not heard or can't be yourself around them, said relationship expert and certified sex therapist at SexualAlpha, Aliyah Moore.\xa0There may be a slew of reasons why you don't want to break it off \u2014 misplaced loyalty, fear of rejection, and guilt, to name a few. The truth is, though, staying in these relationships can build up resentment towards the other person, Cole said. You're also not being honest with yourself or your friend.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            TikTok is obsessed with the 'power struggle stage' of relationships. But what is it?\n            \n\n\nHow can I end a toxic friendship?Before committing to a script, Cole recommends energetically backing away from the friendship by not responding immediately and politely declining plans. The feeling of not vibing with the friendship anymore might be mutual! The mutual backing out of a friendship is what Jackson calls the ""friendship fade-out.""It may be the case, though, that it's not mutual, and you have to have a conversation. Do so privately in a mode that fits for the friendship, whether it be FaceTime or face-to-face. Choose the right time and place, and avoid public situations where your friend may feel embarrassed, Cole said.\xa0\n    The mutual backing out of a friendship is what Jackson calls the ""friendship fade-out.""\n    \nAcknowledge that it's okay to end a friendship, Moore said. ""You don\u2019t have to feel guilty or bad about doing what is best for you.""Jackson has a three-part conversation formula:1. Show your intention at the top of the conversation to set the tone and expectation. This can be like, ""So, I've been thinking a lot about this lately\u2026"" or ""I have something on my mind that I would like to talk to you about\u2026""2. Address your needs and don\u2019t play the blame game. Use \u2018I\u2019 statements as much as you can; rather than ""you are never there for me when I need you..,"" try saying \u201cI need friendships in my life that can prioritize and support me in times of need.""3. Tell them how much you appreciate them and what your intention is for moving forward. This could be, ""I have appreciated our friendship so much and you have been such an integral part of my life. However, I won\u2019t be able to show up in this friendship in the same way that I have before.""If your friend gets emotional, listen to them. While you can't control how they react, you can control how you express yourself. Be prepared for a range of possible emotions, Moore said, whether it be sadness, anger, or confusion. Try to remain calm and compassionate, even if the now-former friend isn't. ""Showing understanding and empathy will help to ensure that the relationship ends in a peaceful manner,"" she said.Be honest and respectful \u2014 and don't ghost. As with most advice, however, there are caveats. If your friend threatened your safety and talking with them would make you feel unsafe, you can end the friendship abruptly and without explanation, Jackson said.\xa0Take time to grieve the relationship as you would a romantic one. It's natural that emotions will come up, even if this is something you want to happen. Respect both your process and theirs; it's okay if it takes time, especially if you were friends for a long time.Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox?

If you ""cut off"" the individual completely, though, it will change the dynamic of the group.If you need to decline group invitations because you know that person will be there, do so, Jackson said. When you're ready to see them again, be cordial; you don't have to pretend to be excited to see them, but you don't have to make it awkward, either.\xa0Don't put the burden of this on your other friends, Jackson continued. Try to refrain from gossiping or making them pick sides. This may be a good opportunity to branch out and make new friends, or reconnect with old ones not in the friend group.Through it all, take care of yourself, said Moore. If you've read this far, you likely want to be empathetic in this journey \u2014 that's more than a lot of people can say when ending relationships. Be kind to yourself and give yourself grace, just as you would to this ex-friend or anyone else.""Ending a friendship can be difficult,"" Moore acknowledged, ""but it is sometimes necessary for the sake of your mental health and wellbeing.""",How do I break up with my toxic friend?,"If a friend is causing more strife than joy, you're not alone: in a Bumble BFF survey from January, 32 percent of respondents said they're not satisfied with the friendships they have in their lives.Sometimes, we need to cut the cord in order to grow.

Verizon is offering a loophole in the form of a free year of Netflix Premium (the tier you'll need for more than two simultaneous streams in different locations). The catch is that you'll have to purchase another subscription, like Paramount+ or Super Duolingo, through play+, Verizon's free subscription hub.

Verizon is offering a loophole in the form of a free year of Netflix Premium (the tier you'll need for more than two simultaneous streams in different locations). The catch is that you'll have to purchase another subscription, like Paramount+ or Super Duolingo, through play+, Verizon's free subscription hub.

In those cases, though, the meat requires tending: You must monitor temperature and rotate or flip the meat to ensure that it gets cooked all the way through. In Yellowjackets, the force that is presumably the spirit of the wilderness forgoes any of those steps, simply chucking some snow on Jackie and calling it a day.

af1234b4-6671-41cf-b661-cfd8bf6708c8,"'Yellowjackets' Season 2: Let's unpack that Greek feast fantasy - Cannibalism has been on the menu for Yellowjackets since its very first episode, but the show has always been fairly coy about how the cannibalism started \u2014 and who was the first person to be eaten. Now, in Season 2's second episode, titled ""Edible Complex,"" we finally get answers to both those questions.In a move that shocks no one (but that we've all been dreading), the Yellowjackets' first taste of human flesh is none other than the frozen, two-month-old body of former team captain Jackie (Ella Purnell). The writing has been on the wall for Jackie's corpse since the Season 2 premiere, but the way in which Yellowjackets depicts the cannibalism is a bit more surprising. Instead of focusing solely on the Yellowjackets' flesh-tearing frenzy, the show cuts between the team's harsh winter reality and a Greek goddess-inspired fantasy \u2014 a tactic that is stylistically and thematically intriguing, but that doesn't completely work in the broader context of Yellowjackets.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 review: Our favorite messed-up cannibals return \u2014 with even more bite\n            \n\n\nWhy does Yellowjackets link cannibalism to a Greek feast?\n\n\n\n\nThe Yellowjackets bid farewell to Jackie.\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nThe Greek feast imagery functions as a major contrast to the Yellowjackets' lived experience. In the former, the team is dirty and clothed in makeshift winter wear. In the latter, they are pristinely groomed, with white robes and elaborate hairstyles that evoke wealth and divinity. The divine Yellowjackets behold a sumptuous feast of wine and delicacies, while their real-life counterparts devour the barbecued corpse of their late friend \u2014 although the characters in both scenes relish their food with the same amounts of zeal.Despite the visual dissonance between the two feast scenes, Yellowjackets uses the Greek banquet as a thematic parallel to what the cannibalism will come to mean for the Yellowjackets. Cannibalism plays a major role in Greek mythology: the titan Kronos eats his children, and in two separate myths, the kings Tantalus and Lycaon try to trick the gods into eating human flesh, with disastrous consequences. (To further the Greek connection: Even the episode title, ""Edible Complex,"" plays on the Greek myth of Oedipus.)The Yellowjackets' feast itself recalls bacchanalia: frenzied celebrations of the Greek god Dionysus, or his Roman counterpart Bacchus. What starts as the Yellowjackets tentatively nibbling the fruits before them quickly descends into wine-splattered revelry. Throughout, they appear to experience the same bliss as those who worship Dionysus, himself the god of ecstasy.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Did you catch these 3 ties between 'Yellowjackets' and 'The Last of Us'?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoomcoming.\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nWomen who followed Dionysus were known as maenads, or ""raving women,"" and there is precedent for maenads tearing victims apart in much the same way the Yellowjackets fall upon Jackie's corpse. In the myth of Pentheus, depicted in The Bacchae by Greek playwright Euripides and the Metamorphoses of Roman poet Ovid, Dionysus leads his cousin Pentheus to the maenads. The maenads proceed to rend him limb from limb in an act of sparagmos, tearing a live victim apart, which in bacchanalia was often followed by the act of omophagia, the consumption of raw flesh. In some versions of the tale, the maenads in their madness believe Pentheus to be a wild animal, similarly to the Yellowjackets' drug-induced hallucinations in Season 1's ""Doomcoming"" episode that led them to think that Travis (Kevin Alves) was an animal and almost sacrifice him.So, Yellowjackets is drawing parallels between its characters and participants in ancient (and violent) Dionysian bacchanalia \u2014 but why? These comparisons serve to complicate the Yellowjackets' cannibalism beyond a gross taboo, weaving it into a greater look at their belief system while stranded in the wilderness.As we know from the very first episode of Yellowjackets, the team develops a ritual around its cannibalism. They chase a victim into a pit, prepare the meat, and eat it around a fire alongside Antler Queen Lottie (Courtney Eaton). The imagery of the Greek feast in the team's very first moment of cannibalism sets this idea of ritual in motion, and adds a layer of religion to it. To the Yellowjackets, this act signals an escalation of their new wilderness-centric faith. After all, we've seen how Lottie wards the team for protection in the wilderness. Their bacchanal-inspired cannibalism may come to serve as an extreme way to appease the strange forces at work in the wild. It's not just a transgression of social norms: It's a show of faith.Does the Greek feast imagery actually work?\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nThe references to Greek myth and ritual sacrifice come through loud and clear in this initial cannibalism sequence, yet they are at odds with the rest of the show.Yellowjackets traffics in departures from reality. Take Lottie's premonitions, Taissa's (Jasmin Savoy Brown) visions of the man with no eyes, and Jackie's pre-death fantasy of a happy reunion with her teammates. Importantly, all those departures are anchored in one character's point of view. For example, when adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) kills Adam (Peter Gadiot) in Season 1 and the show flashes between her and young Shauna (Sophie N\xe9lisse) holding the murder weapon, we understand that this is adult Shauna recalling her past trauma and experiences with murder.Unlike these instances of departure, the Greek feast doesn't have a similar anchor. Could the fantasy be Shauna's way of processing her consumption of Jackie, or is it a shared team delusion? It doesn't feel like either. Instead, it reads more like the show omnisciently framing the cannibalism as a religious act. And that's where the scene falters: Prior fantasies and visions have all been explicitly character-driven. The bacchanalia floats in the ether as something the writers want us to know is important but doesn't tie to anything \u2014 or anyone \u2014 in particular.The Greek allusion is especially jarring given that the show steers clear of such explicit references, although as Sakhi Thirani writes for JStor Daily, the presence of Dionysus is felt throughout. Nowhere is this clearer than during their so-called Doomcoming, which sees the girls on the team dress up and hunt Travis in a fit of bacchanalian madness. Even then, the allusion isn't quite as glaringly obvious as it is in ""Edible Complex."" This fantasy is entirely new to the show, and as such jars us out of a pivotal moment. Of course, there's a high likelihood that the jarring nature of the Greek feast is intentional. We're watching cannibalism unfold; this is no time to be comfortable! Yet I am rarely comfortable watching Yellowjackets anyway: The show does a wonderful job building suspense and creating squirm-worthy moments, all while keeping me immersed. The Greek fantasy being intercut with the actual scene of cannibalism broke that immersion and removed me entirely from the show. Yes, I found myself drawing connections to ancient Greek mythology and religion, but if that comes at the expense of the emotional intensity of Yellowjackets, can that really be a good thing?Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

These comparisons serve to complicate the Yellowjackets' cannibalism beyond a gross taboo, weaving it into a greater look at their belief system while stranded in the wilderness.As we know from the very first episode of Yellowjackets, the team develops a ritual around its cannibalism. They chase a victim into a pit, prepare the meat, and eat it around a fire alongside Antler Queen Lottie (Courtney Eaton). The imagery of the Greek feast in the team's very first moment of cannibalism sets this idea of ritual in motion, and adds a layer of religion to it. To the Yellowjackets, this act signals an escalation of their new wilderness-centric faith. After all, we've seen how Lottie wards the team for protection in the wilderness. Their bacchanal-inspired cannibalism may come to serve as an extreme way to appease the strange forces at work in the wild. It's not just a transgression of social norms: It's a show of faith.Does the Greek feast imagery actually work?\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nThe references to Greek myth and ritual sacrifice come through loud and clear in this initial cannibalism sequence, yet they are at odds with the rest of the show.Yellowjackets traffics in departures from reality. Take Lottie's premonitions, Taissa's (Jasmin Savoy Brown) visions of the man with no eyes, and Jackie's pre-death fantasy of a happy reunion with her teammates. Importantly, all those departures are anchored in one character's point of view. For example, when adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) kills Adam (Peter Gadiot) in Season 1 and the show flashes between her and young Shauna (Sophie N\xe9lisse) holding the murder weapon, we understand that this is adult Shauna recalling her past trauma and experiences with murder.Unlike these instances of departure, the Greek feast doesn't have a similar anchor. Could the fantasy be Shauna's way of processing her consumption of Jackie, or is it a shared team delusion? It doesn't feel like either. Instead, it reads more like the show omnisciently framing the cannibalism as a religious act. And that's where the scene falters: Prior fantasies and visions have all been explicitly character-driven. The bacchanalia floats in the ether as something the writers want us to know is important but doesn't tie to anything \u2014 or anyone \u2014 in particular.The Greek allusion is especially jarring given that the show steers clear of such explicit references, although as Sakhi Thirani writes for JStor Daily, the presence of Dionysus is felt throughout. Nowhere is this clearer than during their so-called Doomcoming, which sees the girls on the team dress up and hunt Travis in a fit of bacchanalian madness. Even then, the allusion isn't quite as glaringly obvious as it is in ""Edible Complex."" This fantasy is entirely new to the show, and as such jars us out of a pivotal moment. Of course, there's a high likelihood that the jarring nature of the Greek feast is intentional. We're watching cannibalism unfold; this is no time to be comfortable! Yet I am rarely comfortable watching Yellowjackets anyway: The show does a wonderful job building suspense and creating squirm-worthy moments, all while keeping me immersed. The Greek fantasy being intercut with the actual scene of cannibalism broke that immersion and removed me entirely from the show. Yes, I found myself drawing connections to ancient Greek mythology and religion, but if that comes at the expense of the emotional intensity of Yellowjackets, can that really be a good thing?Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

14465039-ca8b-43ed-8ccc-6ccb832cabac,"Long COVID and suicide: How patients are helping each other in their darkest hour - When Sam Norpel became ill with COVID in December 2021, she worked through the infection to meet a deadline. The former chief digital officer had a product to launch and no time to waste. Norpel met the deadline by working from bed, but her life became unrecognizable.A few months later, now debilitated and bedridden by long COVID, the 48-year-old mother of three and family breadwinner confronted an unfamiliar foe: suicidal thoughts. First, a malicious idea crossed her mind. Why hadn't COVID just killed her, she wondered, as financial concerns mounted and chronic pain persisted. That thought faded as her health improved. But months later, following worsened neurological symptoms that preceded a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, she experienced specific suicidal thoughts that felt far more insidious. ""It was that my whole identity was fractured,"" says Norpel. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            21 reasons to keep living when you feel suicidal\n            \n\n\nA loving text from her teenage son, sent unwittingly at precisely the right time, helped alleviate the intensity of Norpel's thoughts. So did an exchange with another long COVID survivor who reached out to her online, and who also felt suicidal. For the first time in a while, Norpel felt useful as she offered empathy. She had missed feeling like her life had meaning. Norpel's experience isn't anomalous. On Facebook, Twitter, and in other online groups and communities built by long COVID survivors, the topic often comes up, either in public conversations or direct messages. As pandemic emergency declarations expire, long COVID patients say it feels like they're being left behind, without the financial, medical, and mental health resources to navigate their chronic illness \u2014 and the despair that can accompany it. But survivors interviewed by Mashable say that the empathetic connections found in their online communities offer a refuge from suicidal feelings, give them elusive hope, and help restore their sense of purpose.Long COVID, suicide, and online communitiesThough suicide is complex and caused by multiple factors, the possibility that long COVID increases risk is concerning given that an estimated 11 percent of the U.S. adult population currently has long COVID, broadly defined as signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after the initial phase of COVID infection. Serious illness, including chronic disease, is a risk factor for suicide. But so are other experiences that commonly occur in long COVID's wake, including unemployment, relationship troubles, financial strain, and social isolation. Some survivors lose health insurance, or never had it, and can't access mental or physical healthcare, which is another risk factor for suicide. Research also suggests that brain inflammation, which COVID can cause, may increase a person's risk for depression and suicidal thinking. Indeed, one preliminary study found that long COVID may be associated with suicide risk and concluded that ""psychiatric disorders and suicide risk should be systematically assessed in patients with long COVID.""While there are long COVID patients who don't contemplate suicide, many with severe or debilitating long COVID describe how the illness suddenly destroys their carefully built lives. Some have no prior experience with mental illness, much less with suicidal thoughts, and feel afraid as they struggle to process these feelings. When they confide in each other, the effect can be lifesaving. The prominent suicide death of former television writer Heidi Ferrer, who had experienced long COVID, drew attention to the possibility of heightened risk when it became public in June 2021. In the public Survivor Corps Facebook group, where Ferrer was a member, people routinely respond with kindness and understanding to posters who, plagued by debilitating symptoms, feel they can't go on. Dozens of replies effectively say, in unison, ""We've been there, too \u2014 just hold on."" Some post contact information for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or other crisis lines. The group currently escalates explicitly suicidal posts to Facebook's moderation team, which reviews them and may reach out to the poster with resources. Survivor Corps founder Diana G\xfcthe calls the group of nearly 200,000 people the ""epicenter of hope"" for long COVID patients. But as Survivor Corps, the nonprofit organization, winds down its official activities for lack of funding, it will also stop paying moderators to manage the Facebook group, leaving uncertainty about how it will continue given that each post is personally pre-approved. Want more stories about mental health in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletters today.A separate, much smaller and private Facebook group run on behalf of the federal Disaster Distress Helpline also offers a peer support community for long COVID patients, as do several other private Facebook groups. Many long COVID survivors find support groups like these by luck, either seeking them out online or by receiving treatment at long COVID clinics, which typically have lengthy waiting lists. The Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS) Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center effectively became a long COVID clinic during the pandemic and hosts several weekly video support groups. Current members live across the U.S., and receiving care at CIBS isn't a requirement to join, but the waitlist is currently 50 people long.""When you look over the long COVID landscape it can feel very hopeless,"" says Dr. James C. Jackson, a neuropsychologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who runs the support groups and notes that members talk about positive developments like improved symptoms or becoming more resilient. ""So to be in a community with people where you're hearing stories of overcoming...it really adds a lot of hope."" Finding support from other long COVID survivorsJackson says that in addition to chronic health issues, survivors grapple with day-to-day uncertainty about their well-being, livelihood, and future; medical professionals who may not believe, or cannot say, that there's anything wrong; social isolation because they're housebound or fear getting infected again; and, overall, a total dismantling of their identity. ""Part of the dynamic is life gets turned on its head pretty quickly for these folks and they don't know how to make sense of it,"" says Jackson, author of the forthcoming book Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long Covid\u2014A Practical Guide.Three of the CIBS support group's members interviewed by Mashable, who requested anonymity to protect their privacy, say participating is vital for their mental health. Marie, 57, lived with depression and anxiety that were treated with medication and therapy, but she never experienced suicidal thoughts prior to being hospitalized with COVID in March 2020. Among other medical conditions, she now has cognitive impairment, constant fatigue, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a blood circulation disorder that can cause lightheadedness, fainting, and rapid heartbeat. ""I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID,"" she says.\n    ""I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID.""\n            - Marie, long COVID survivor\n\nWhile long COVID exacerbated Marie's depression and anxiety, the arrival of suicidal thoughts still came as a ""scary"" shock. But when she told the group she was spiraling, others provided a ""lifeline"" through their understanding and compassion, Marie says. When she came close to acting on her suicidal thoughts last fall, Marie sought Jackson's help and checked into a weeklong inpatient psychiatric program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a decision she describes as the ""hardest but best thing in my life.""Suzanne, 46, says that every long COVID survivor should have access to a support group like the one offered through CIBS. Suzanne, whose husband of 20 years died of his COVID infection, experiences POTS, migraines, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and joint and muscle pain, among other health issues. For the past year and a half, she's brought her concerns to meetings and has never felt gaslit or dismissed. She also finds it rewarding to support others. Alex, a 23-year-old former competitive runner who surrendered his dreams of a career in the sport after contracting long COVID, experiences unpredictable flares in his symptoms, which also come with intense waves of depression, anxiety, and, sometimes, suicidal thinking. He says that the group rallies around members ""going through the ringer,"" which makes him feel less alone. ""This community kind of rises together to hold this person up when they can no longer hold themselves up,"" says Alex. Seeking solutions for long COVID and suicideFor Sam Norpel, the second bout of suicidal thoughts, about a year after her COVID infection, convinced her to share those feelings with her medical care team. She also told close family members how badly she was struggling, despite improvements to her physical health. Though she experiences speech issues, migraines, chronic fatigue and pain, and dysautonomia, a term used to describe problems with the body's autonomic nervous system, Norpel has joined the board of the nonprofit organization Pandemic Patients, in a limited capacity. She says this work, along with continuing to communicate online with other survivors, gives her a long-missing sense of purpose. Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, says that hearing survivors' stories is critical to understanding how best to support them. She emphasizes that experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time can be confusing and frightening. People may feel ashamed of having those thoughts. But she encourages survivors to think of suicidal feelings, which involve the brain, like any other health indicator that suggests something isn't functioning optimally, such as high blood pressure. While Marshall says there's not enough research to demonstrate a link between long COVID and heightened suicide risk, she says it's important that survivors do not suffer alone, and that employers and policymakers meaningfully address and support patients' mental health. Friends and family can also play a crucial role by checking in with loved ones who have long COVID, including asking if they're having thoughts about suicide if they notice talk of hopelessness, feeling like a burden, or sudden changes in mood or behavior. ""These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people...most people look at someone and do not realize they may be struggling with long COVID symptoms, and particularly mental health symptoms as a result,"" she says. \n    ""These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people.""\n            - Dr. Doreen Marshall, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\n\nMarshall recommends that survivors experiencing intense suicidal thoughts contact a crisis line. While some survivors express skepticism about hotlines, partly fearing that those on the other end won't believe long COVID is real, Crisis Text Line and the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline told Mashable that their staff are ready to offer support. Crisis Text Line provides its volunteers with separate tip sheets about chronic pain and the long-lasting effects of COVID. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has resources related to COVID's impact on families, mental health, and managing relationships.Dr. Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine whose patients include those experiencing long COVID, says healthcare professionals should act with more sensitivity and compassion toward survivors. While mental healthcare can be very helpful for patients, Gold says physicians should resist the impulse to send them to a therapist solely because medical tests haven't pointed to a conclusive physical diagnosis. Gold says simply telling patients, ""I don't know what this is, but I believe you,"" would be far better than indicating that their physical symptoms are essentially ""all in their head."" ""A lot of people turn to the internet and patient-supported communities because they want to know they're not alone,"" she says. ""They want to know that people see them and believe them. A lot of times that comes from peers, and doesn't come from medicine.""At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Jackson, who is also a research professor of medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, works with patients and support group members to identify what aspects of their condition they can live with, even if they'd rather not. Using treatment known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the aim is to lessen their emotional reactivity and find a way to ""co-exist"" with a certain level of discomfort or pain. Support group member Suzanne has found this strategy helpful: ""COVID and the devastation it leaves behind is definitely unmeasurable. But just trying to practice acceptance is not the same as giving up, or giving in, either.""Jackson also teaches a strategy called ""unhooking"" wherein patients note thoughts that steal their focus and sap their hope, like the thought that things will never get better. Instead of becoming swept up in their implications, patients learn to simply observe them. And Jackson urges survivors to find and embrace the parts of themselves, from before the infection, that still exist. Marie knows she doesn't want to end her life, but the side of her brain ""that isn't quite working right"" can insist otherwise in her darkest moments, which is why support from other long COVID survivors has been so critical to her survival.""You're just at the end of your rope,"" she says, ""and you need someone to help you at the end of that rope.""If you're feeling suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody.

Survivor Corps founder Diana G\xfcthe calls the group of nearly 200,000 people the ""epicenter of hope"" for long COVID patients. But as Survivor Corps, the nonprofit organization, winds down its official activities for lack of funding, it will also stop paying moderators to manage the Facebook group, leaving uncertainty about how it will continue given that each post is personally pre-approved.

Sign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletters today.A separate, much smaller and private Facebook group run on behalf of the federal Disaster Distress Helpline also offers a peer support community for long COVID patients, as do several other private Facebook groups. Many long COVID survivors find support groups like these by luck, either seeking them out online or by receiving treatment at long COVID clinics, which typically have lengthy waiting lists. The Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS) Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center effectively became a long COVID clinic during the pandemic and hosts several weekly video support groups. Current members live across the U.S., and receiving care at CIBS isn't a requirement to join, but the waitlist is currently 50 people long.""When you look over the long COVID landscape it can feel very hopeless,"" says Dr. James C. Jackson, a neuropsychologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who runs the support groups and notes that members talk about positive developments like improved symptoms or becoming more resilient. ""So to be in a community with people where you're hearing stories of overcoming...it really adds a lot of hope."" Finding support from other long COVID survivorsJackson says that in addition to chronic health issues, survivors grapple with day-to-day uncertainty about their well-being, livelihood, and future; medical professionals who may not believe, or cannot say, that there's anything wrong; social isolation because they're housebound or fear getting infected again; and, overall, a total dismantling of their identity. ""Part of the dynamic is life gets turned on its head pretty quickly for these folks and they don't know how to make sense of it,"" says Jackson, author of the forthcoming book Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long Covid\u2014A Practical Guide.Three of the CIBS support group's members interviewed by Mashable, who requested anonymity to protect their privacy, say participating is vital for their mental health. Marie, 57, lived with depression and anxiety that were treated with medication and therapy, but she never experienced suicidal thoughts prior to being hospitalized with COVID in March 2020. Among other medical conditions, she now has cognitive impairment, constant fatigue, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a blood circulation disorder that can cause lightheadedness, fainting, and rapid heartbeat. ""I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID,"" she says.\n    ""I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID.""\n            - Marie, long COVID survivor\n\nWhile long COVID exacerbated Marie's depression and anxiety, the arrival of suicidal thoughts still came as a ""scary"" shock. But when she told the group she was spiraling, others provided a ""lifeline"" through their understanding and compassion, Marie says. When she came close to acting on her suicidal thoughts last fall, Marie sought Jackson's help and checked into a weeklong inpatient psychiatric program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a decision she describes as the ""hardest but best thing in my life.""Suzanne, 46, says that every long COVID survivor should have access to a support group like the one offered through CIBS. Suzanne, whose husband of 20 years died of his COVID infection, experiences POTS, migraines, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and joint and muscle pain, among other health issues. For the past year and a half, she's brought her concerns to meetings and has never felt gaslit or dismissed. She also finds it rewarding to support others. Alex, a 23-year-old former competitive runner who surrendered his dreams of a career in the sport after contracting long COVID, experiences unpredictable flares in his symptoms, which also come with intense waves of depression, anxiety, and, sometimes, suicidal thinking. He says that the group rallies around members ""going through the ringer,"" which makes him feel less alone. ""This community kind of rises together to hold this person up when they can no longer hold themselves up,"" says Alex. Seeking solutions for long COVID and suicideFor Sam Norpel, the second bout of suicidal thoughts, about a year after her COVID infection, convinced her to share those feelings with her medical care team. She also told close family members how badly she was struggling, despite improvements to her physical health. Though she experiences speech issues, migraines, chronic fatigue and pain, and dysautonomia, a term used to describe problems with the body's autonomic nervous system, Norpel has joined the board of the nonprofit organization Pandemic Patients, in a limited capacity. She says this work, along with continuing to communicate online with other survivors, gives her a long-missing sense of purpose. Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, says that hearing survivors' stories is critical to understanding how best to support them. She emphasizes that experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time can be confusing and frightening. People may feel ashamed of having those thoughts. But she encourages survivors to think of suicidal feelings, which involve the brain, like any other health indicator that suggests something isn't functioning optimally, such as high blood pressure. While Marshall says there's not enough research to demonstrate a link between long COVID and heightened suicide risk, she says it's important that survivors do not suffer alone, and that employers and policymakers meaningfully address and support patients' mental health. Friends and family can also play a crucial role by checking in with loved ones who have long COVID, including asking if they're having thoughts about suicide if they notice talk of hopelessness, feeling like a burden, or sudden changes in mood or behavior. ""These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people...most people look at someone and do not realize they may be struggling with long COVID symptoms, and particularly mental health symptoms as a result,"" she says. \n    ""These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people.""\n            - Dr. Doreen Marshall, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\n\nMarshall recommends that survivors experiencing intense suicidal thoughts contact a crisis line. While some survivors express skepticism about hotlines, partly fearing that those on the other end won't believe long COVID is real, Crisis Text Line and the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline told Mashable that their staff are ready to offer support. Crisis Text Line provides its volunteers with separate tip sheets about chronic pain and the long-lasting effects of COVID. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has resources related to COVID's impact on families, mental health, and managing relationships.Dr. Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine whose patients include those experiencing long COVID, says healthcare professionals should act with more sensitivity and compassion toward survivors. While mental healthcare can be very helpful for patients, Gold says physicians should resist the impulse to send them to a therapist solely because medical tests haven't pointed to a conclusive physical diagnosis. Gold says simply telling patients, ""I don't know what this is, but I believe you,"" would be far better than indicating that their physical symptoms are essentially ""all in their head."" ""A lot of people turn to the internet and patient-supported communities because they want to know they're not alone,"" she says. ""They want to know that people see them and believe them. A lot of times that comes from peers, and doesn't come from medicine.""At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Jackson, who is also a research professor of medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, works with patients and support group members to identify what aspects of their condition they can live with, even if they'd rather not. Using treatment known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the aim is to lessen their emotional reactivity and find a way to ""co-exist"" with a certain level of discomfort or pain. Support group member Suzanne has found this strategy helpful: ""COVID and the devastation it leaves behind is definitely unmeasurable. But just trying to practice acceptance is not the same as giving up, or giving in, either.""Jackson also teaches a strategy called ""unhooking"" wherein patients note thoughts that steal their focus and sap their hope, like the thought that things will never get better. Instead of becoming swept up in their implications, patients learn to simply observe them. And Jackson urges survivors to find and embrace the parts of themselves, from before the infection, that still exist. Marie knows she doesn't want to end her life, but the side of her brain ""that isn't quite working right"" can insist otherwise in her darkest moments, which is why support from other long COVID survivors has been so critical to her survival.""You're just at the end of your rope,"" she says, ""and you need someone to help you at the end of that rope.""If you're feeling suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody.

Over 100 million black holes likely wander our galaxy alone, and they are fascinating objects in the cosmos. They're unimaginably dense: If Earth was (hypothetically) crushed into a black hole, it would be under an inch across. This profound density gives black holes phenomenal gravitational power. But, fortunately, black holes aren't cosmic vacuum cleaners.

This is true. There are countless black holes out there, and some are invariably positioned toward us. The most massive Earth-facing black holes, which can be billions of times more massive than the sun and dwell at the center of galaxies, are called ""blazars."" They are powerful objects.

It's a bit like seeing different views of a peacock with its glorious tail open, explained Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.

7a1bfb3f-020e-4417-b6fd-4217635ba9c7,"'Yellowjackets' episode 2, explained: The confusing hunger of teen friendships becomes literal - Who knew cannibalism could be so lavish?\xa0We've all been waiting for the Yellowjackets to officially turn into flesh-eating comrades, after Season 1's many hints, and our remarkably concerning wishes come true in Season 2 episode 2, ""Edible Complex."" We all saw it coming, but boy, did we not expect it to be quite like that.Played out as a lush bacchanalian banquet juxtaposed with the ruthless reality, the Yellowjackets munch their way through Jackie's (Ella Purnell) toasted corpse in a no-frills feast where no part of her is off the menu. However, their delightfully dreadful dinner hadn't actually been part of the plan; the team had been trying to cremate Jackie's body in order to let everyone \u2014 but especially Shauna (Sophie N\xe9lisse) \u2014 move on. Instead, a pile of snow lands on Jackie's burning corpse, snuffing out the fire so her flesh is slow-roasted instead. Following their noses and their tummies, the team slowly shuffles towards Jackie's body with a salivating Shauna boldly declaring, ""She wants us to.""\xa0Now, we all know Shauna's been tempted to have a little bite for a while. Her small snack in Season 2's first episode did in fact scream, ""Hey! They're about to start eating each other!"" It all makes a lot of sense considering that they're starving, and Shauna's pregnancy means she's really eating for two. But with Shauna's incredibly questionable behavior since Jackie's death, is it possible that she always knew \u2014 or even hoped \u2014 the team was going to have to eat her at some point? Let's rewind.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJust two bffs hanging out. \nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\n\n\nAt the start of Season 2, we learned that it's been two months since Jackie's death. Instead of burying her or cremating her right after, the Yellowjackets decided to let Shauna mourn in her own special way \u2014 keeping Jackie's corpse in the group's meat shed and letting Shauna spend hours on end with her in it everyday. Shauna's been imagining conversations with Jackie, posing her corpse, talking to it, and even playing dress up. While a part of Shauna's hallucinations is based on her perception of Jackie, another huge part of it is Shauna's internal psyche projecting onto her friend. We're really listening to Shauna's internal thoughts and conflicts in these conversations, and in episode 2, we start listening to the devil and angel on Shauna's shoulders speaking in real time.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 episode 1 features the single greatest Jeff moment so far\n            \n\n\nHer conversations with Jackie slowly start to get more twisted, with Jackie tempting Shauna to eat her. This imaginary Jackie is almost validating Shauna's darkest thoughts, reassuring her that she doesn't need her body anymore, the baby needs to eat, and that Travis (Kevin Alves) and Nat's (Sophie Thatcher) hunting endeavors are a moot point. But we're really listening to Shauna trying to justify her cravings in those moments, and imagining an impossible consent to cave into them. The temptation reaches a climax when Shauna accidentally peels off a layer from Jackie's skin, which almost undeniably suggests that a deeper part of her was ready to eat Jackie's body despite her surface-level reluctance \u2014 which makes her reaction to Jackie's funeral all the more telling.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nRIP Jackie, but not really. \nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\n\n\nSimmering underneath Shauna's craving is a heavily alluded-to crush towards Jackie. You might not see it if you haven't experienced it, but Shauna and Jackie's relationship perfectly encapsulates the unique, complicated kind of queer awakening that can arise between same-sex best friends at that age. The entire experience is a mess of feelings, a constant see-saw between ""Wait, do I just really want to be like her?"" or ""Whoah, do I want to be with her?"" (Shauna sleeping with Jeff could be seen as another aspect of this push-pull desire.) Maybe by eating Jackie, Shauna thought she could hold on to a piece of her friend forever \u2014 bones and all, as they say.When the Yellowjackets suggest burying Jackie, Shauna defensively rejects the idea saying the ground is too cold to dig through (something that was also eerily said by another onscreen cannibal we've seen this year). Was Shauna's reaction really out of not wanting to let go of Jackie yet, or was she scared that the team was about to waste her secret resource? Or was it actually both? Shauna's eulogy for Jackie begins ""I don't know where you end and I begin,"" which soon becomes literal in every way when Shauna consumes her, but it rings true emotionally; something heavily implies she's always seen herself and Jackie as one, infinite, non-negotiable vessel \u2014 whether that's as friends, crushes, or meals. By eating Jackie, she's making sure that vessel stays afloat.Even if the Yellowjackets had decided to keep Jackie's body in the meat shed, Shauna surely was going to have another bite of her at some point. Based on her conversations with Jackie, the ear snack, the skin peeling, and all the subliminal love and desire brewing beneath the surface, eating Jackie was always going to be an end goal for Shauna, whether or not she would ever admit it. The group deciding to cremate her just expedited the process. And when Jackie's body accidentally cooks instead of chars, Shauna doesn't miss a single beat, taking it immediately as a sign to dig in.\xa0Maybe the build-up to Jackie's devouring could have been a coincidental turn of events, but this is Yellowjackets, and it isn't too farfetched to believe that a part of Shauna always knew this was going to happen and was just waiting for the right time. The forest sending that gust of snow was all she needed to reaffirm her desire \u2014 the final seal on a deal she's been trying to make for two months. And by the Yellowjackets' mutual willingness, it almost feels like eating Jackie was an unspoken agreement the team's had for a while, they were just waiting for Shauna's blessing \u2014 and boy, did she give it to them.\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.","'Yellowjackets' episode 2, explained: The confusing hunger of teen friendships becomes literal","Who knew cannibalism could be so lavish?\xa0We've all been waiting for the Yellowjackets to officially turn into flesh-eating comrades, after Season 1's many hints, and our remarkably concerning wishes come true in Season 2 episode 2, ""Edible Complex.""

Instead, a pile of snow lands on Jackie's burning corpse, snuffing out the fire so her flesh is slow-roasted instead. Following their noses and their tummies, the team slowly shuffles towards Jackie's body with a salivating Shauna boldly declaring, ""She wants us to.""\xa0Now, we all know Shauna's been tempted to have a little bite for a while. Her small snack in Season 2's first episode did in fact scream, ""Hey! They're about to start eating each other!"" It all makes a lot of sense considering that they're starving, and Shauna's pregnancy means she's really eating for two. But with Shauna's incredibly questionable behavior since Jackie's death, is it possible that she always knew \u2014 or even hoped \u2014 the team was going to have to eat her at some point? Let's rewind.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJust two bffs hanging out. \nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\n\n\nAt the start of Season 2, we learned that it's been two months since Jackie's death. Instead of burying her or cremating her right after, the Yellowjackets decided to let Shauna mourn in her own special way \u2014 keeping Jackie's corpse in the group's meat shed and letting Shauna spend hours on end with her in it everyday. Shauna's been imagining conversations with Jackie, posing her corpse, talking to it, and even playing dress up. While a part of Shauna's hallucinations is based on her perception of Jackie, another huge part of it is Shauna's internal psyche projecting onto her friend. We're really listening to Shauna's internal thoughts and conflicts in these conversations, and in episode 2, we start listening to the devil and angel on Shauna's shoulders speaking in real time.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 episode 1 features the single greatest Jeff moment so far\n            \n\n\nHer conversations with Jackie slowly start to get more twisted, with Jackie tempting Shauna to eat her. This imaginary Jackie is almost validating Shauna's darkest thoughts, reassuring her that she doesn't need her body anymore, the baby needs to eat, and that Travis (Kevin Alves) and Nat's (Sophie Thatcher) hunting endeavors are a moot point. But we're really listening to Shauna trying to justify her cravings in those moments, and imagining an impossible consent to cave into them. The temptation reaches a climax when Shauna accidentally peels off a layer from Jackie's skin, which almost undeniably suggests that a deeper part of her was ready to eat Jackie's body despite her surface-level reluctance \u2014 which makes her reaction to Jackie's funeral all the more telling.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nRIP Jackie, but not really. \nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\n\n\nSimmering underneath Shauna's craving is a heavily alluded-to crush towards Jackie. You might not see it if you haven't experienced it, but Shauna and Jackie's relationship perfectly encapsulates the unique, complicated kind of queer awakening that can arise between same-sex best friends at that age. The entire experience is a mess of feelings, a constant see-saw between ""Wait, do I just really want to be like her?"" or ""Whoah, do I want to be with her?"" (Shauna sleeping with Jeff could be seen as another aspect of this push-pull desire.) Maybe by eating Jackie, Shauna thought she could hold on to a piece of her friend forever \u2014 bones and all, as they say.When the Yellowjackets suggest burying Jackie, Shauna defensively rejects the idea saying the ground is too cold to dig through (something that was also eerily said by another onscreen cannibal we've seen this year). Was Shauna's reaction really out of not wanting to let go of Jackie yet, or was she scared that the team was about to waste her secret resource? Or was it actually both? Shauna's eulogy for Jackie begins ""I don't know where you end and I begin,"" which soon becomes literal in every way when Shauna consumes her, but it rings true emotionally; something heavily implies she's always seen herself and Jackie as one, infinite, non-negotiable vessel \u2014 whether that's as friends, crushes, or meals. By eating Jackie, she's making sure that vessel stays afloat.Even if the Yellowjackets had decided to keep Jackie's body in the meat shed, Shauna surely was going to have another bite of her at some point. Based on her conversations with Jackie, the ear snack, the skin peeling, and all the subliminal love and desire brewing beneath the surface, eating Jackie was always going to be an end goal for Shauna, whether or not she would ever admit it. The group deciding to cremate her just expedited the process. And when Jackie's body accidentally cooks instead of chars, Shauna doesn't miss a single beat, taking it immediately as a sign to dig in.\xa0Maybe the build-up to Jackie's devouring could have been a coincidental turn of events, but this is Yellowjackets, and it isn't too farfetched to believe that a part of Shauna always knew this was going to happen and was just waiting for the right time. The forest sending that gust of snow was all she needed to reaffirm her desire \u2014 the final seal on a deal she's been trying to make for two months. And by the Yellowjackets' mutual willingness, it almost feels like eating Jackie was an unspoken agreement the team's had for a while, they were just waiting for Shauna's blessing \u2014 and boy, did she give it to them.\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:It's so yesterday.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Nope, not today.Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter M.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Wordle-obsessed? These are the best word games to play IRL.\n            \n\n\nWhat's the answer to Wordle today?We're finally about to reveal the answer to today's Wordle, so get your guesses in now!Are you ready?The solution to Wordle #651 is...MARCH.Don't feel discouraged if you didn't get it this time.

By game standards, this means he's a full caster. Bards can cast iconic spells like Vicious Mockery, as well as magically inspire fellow players with Bardic Inspiration.

""Magic is so powerful and can solve so many problems that we decided we really wanted to limit it to certain characters, because then it forces them to find other ways through.""Adding to that idea of problem-solving is the fact that Dungeons & Dragons spells aren't always a surefire way to get out of a jam.

550e372f-6a1e-4422-b979-88f0de601116,"'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for April 1 - If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\u201cKwordle.\u201d It should rhyme with \u201cWordle,\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like ""curdle.\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\u2019ve narrowed it down to \u201c-IGHT,\u201d you could guess \u201cMIGHT\u201d \u201cNIGHT\u201d \u201cLIGHT\u201d and \u201cSIGHT\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \u201chard mode.\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \u201cNOTES,\u201d \u201cACRID,\u201d and \u201cLUMPY.\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \u201cCANOE,\u201d \u201cSKIRT,\u201d \u201cPLUMB,\u201d and \u201cFUDGY.\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\u2019s Quordle words?One of them has a twice-occurring letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?X.What do today\u2019s Quordle words start with?G, M, E, and H.What are the answers for today\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

For many fans and wrestlers, however, it's basically the Superbowl. It's March Madness. The Masters, the NBA Championship, and the World Series. It's the be-all, end-all of professional wrestling. As such, WWE puts a lot of investment and spectacle into making each WrestleMania as memorable as the lastThe event takes place between mid-March and early April each year, with the company bringing together its best wrestlers (or superstars as the company refers to them as), legends, and celebrities in front of a massive audience of millions around the world watching at home or attending live.In an interview with Chuck Carroll of CBS ahead of WrestleMania 35, Becky Lynch explained what Mania and main eventing it meant to her:""I have been obsessing about this.

Or at least give you an idea of what's happening so you're not clueless in front of your wrestling friends:The story so far...Cody Rhodes vs Roman ReignsThe headliner of WrestleMania is the fated clash between two famous wrestling dynasties: The Anao'i family and the Rhodes. In the winner-takes-all championship main event for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship (the unified combination of the Universal Championship and WWE Championship), Roman Reigns will defend his title against Cody Rhodes.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nIt would take an entirely separate article to fully explain the path each of these superstars took to reach this point but here's the long story short. For the past three years, Roman Reigns, known as ""The Tribal Chief,"" has held the Undisputed Universal Championship since August 2020. As the ""Head of the Table"" and the leader of his family, The Bloodline, Reigns is the company's longest-reigning champion since 1988. A member of the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty, Reigns is a first cousin once removed to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and fellow Bloodline members, twin brothers the Usos (Jimmy and Jey) and their younger brother Solo Sikoa.Reigns rules his family and WWE with an iron fist and, since the formation of the Bloodline, has spent the last two years emotionally and physically torturing his cousin Jey Uso through verbal abuse and a myriad of needless loyalty tests. Jey was Reigns' first challenger after the latter won the Universal Championship in August 2020, beating him unconscious in the match to the point Jey's brother, Jimmy, had to throw in the towel for him. Since then, Reigns has become a paranoid, loathsome villain unsure if he can trust his own family, incessantly seeking acknowledgment from any and everyone to mask his own insecurities.His challenger, ""The American Nightmare"" Cody Rhodes. The son of the dearly departed wrestling legend  ""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes, Cody is one match away from achieving something no one in his family has done in WWE: winning the world championship. At once considered a WWE-lifer, Cody shocked the pro wrestling world and left WWE in 2016. From there, he traveled the world, wrestling everywhere from bingo halls to the Tokyo Dome in Japan. Making his mark in the greater world of wrestling outside WWE, Cody was instrumental in the creation of All Elite Wrestling, the biggest pro wrestling promotion to rival WWE since the shuttering of WCW in 2001. With AEW, Cody served as executive vice president and was one of the company's top stars. Cody then shocked the world again by leaving AEW to return to where it all started\u2014back to WWE. The winner of the annual Royal Rumble match (a 30-man battle royale where the winner receives a WrestleMania main event), Cody has the opportunity to do something no one in WWE has not been able to do in three years: beat Roman Reigns. Having not suffered a 1-v-1 loss since 2020, The Tribal Chief could be an insurmountable challenge for Cody at WrestleMania. However, thanks to growing resentment within the Bloodline, the thing that could stop Roman Reigns might be his own family.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nThe betrayal and redemption of Sami ZaynAn integral component of the brewing collapse within the Bloodline is that of Canadian wrestler Sami Zayn, who, along with fellow Canadian and friend Kevin Owens, is set to take on the Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. \n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nSince this time last year, Zayn has been an unofficial member of the Bloodline, forming an alliance with the Tribal Chief when the former was seeking help during a feud with Drew McIntyre. Before long \u2014 and much to Jey\u2019s chagrin \u2014 Sami Zayn seemed to make his way into Roman Reigns\u2019 inner circle. In November, after much tension, Zayn finally proved himself a member of the Bloodline by low blowing his friend Kevin Owens (yes the guy he's teaming up with Saturday. Their history together is also a long story for another time). Even after this, Reigns, a paranoid narcissist, called into question Zayn's loyalty. This time he was saved by Jey who had finally come to accept him into the family.\n\n\nThat little heartfelt moment didn't last for long. At the Royal Rumble, after successfully defending his title against Owens, Reigns tasked Zayn with once again harming his best friend. But this time, Zayn did something not even Jey could do in the past few years\u2014Sami fought back. In genuinely one of the best moments in recent WWE memory, Zayn finally fought back against the abuse laid out to him by Reigns and took a steel chair to Tribal Chief to save his best friend. The event has started a road to redemption for the once delusional sycophant and set the stage for not only the tag team championship but the main event as well. \n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nBianca Belair and the women of WWE continue to make historyWrestleMania is all about full circle moments and nothing feels more full circle than both Women's Championship matches. The first is Bianca Belair's championship defense of her Raw Women's title against Asuka. Belair, the longest reigning Black world champion in the company's history and one-half of the first-ever WrestleMania main event to feature two black women, is set to defend a title she won last year at...WrestleMania. A former collegiate track athlete with no background in pro wrestling, Belair has made her mark as one of WWE's top stars, breaking down doors and barriers in the sport that was once inaccessible to women and Black wrestlers.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nCalled the ""EST of WWE"" (because she's the fastEST and strongEST), Belair is set to defend against the world-weary veteran Asuka, who's become a staple of WWE programming in the last half-decade. Asuka made her name known working in Japan and has won every accomplishment possible in WWE. Just like Belair, Asuka is a pioneer for women's wrestling in WWE and their clash at WrestleMania is sure to steal the show.Another full-circle moment in the women's division sees Rhea Ripley challenge Charlottle Flair for the Smackdown's Women's Championship. Three years ago, Flair won the Women's Royal Rumble and challenged Ripley for the NXT Women's Championship. Ripley lost to Flair on that night and has never beaten her since.Now, the roles are reversed with Ripley having won the Women's Royal Rumble and challenging Flair for her title at this year's WrestleMania. Ripley has taken on a meaner, darker persona since then having joined the Judgement Day, a faction of wrestlers best described as goth bullies.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nA rematch three years in the making, Ripley vs Flair is the likely main event for night one.Another marquee matchup on night one is a six-women tag team match featuring wrestling legends Trish Stratus and Lita. Joined by Becky Lynch, the winner of the first-ever women's WrestleMania main event, the three women will face Damage CTRL (Bayley, IO SKY, Dakota Kai). The story at play is that Damage CTRL has been disrespecting the good names of these iconic WWE legends.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nStratus and Lita have done a lot of work to lay the foundation of the women's revolution and it's a treat for fans to see the two perform at WrestleMania once again since the two retired as full-timers years ago.Best of the rest of the cardThat just about covers the bigger storylines going into WrestleMania 39, but what about the matches on the card? While not the A stories featured on this year's Showcase of the Immortals, there are plenty of fights that might be of interest to keep you invested through the night's events.The first is a pair of matches featuring members of the aforementioned faction of goth bullies, The Judgement Day. Dominik Mysterio, the son of the iconic luchador Rey Mysterio, is set to face his father after months of goading and disrespect by the former. Rey has finally had enough of his son's antics which include many, many ruined holiday dinners and even a night in jail. \n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nThe second Judgment Day match is between the faction's leader Finn Balor and former leader Edge. Set inside Hell in a Cell (basically a giant steel cage), this is the end of a vicious rivalry that saw Balor and Judgement Day put Edge's wife in the hospital. If you've ever felt the shame and humiliation of being kicked out of the spooky, supernatural friend group that you started, then you can understand why Edge is upset. Especially after said friend group of goth bullies spend months harassing you and your family.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nIf you're a fan of genetic freaks of nature doing things no one that size should be doing, you'll enjoy  Brock Lesnar vs Omos and the WWE Intercontinental Championship match between Gunther, Sheamus, and Drew McIntyre.

Paul has made a couple of WWE appearances which included a world championship match against Reigns in Saudi Arabia (I promise that's a real thing that happened). To the surprise of many, Paul has taken quickly to the ring thanks to his impressive athleticism and his work as a social media influencer making him a natural entertainer in a business that calls itself ""sports entertainment.""

Infamously, former-NFL star Lawrence Taylor wrestled in the main event of WrestleMania 11, Floyd Mayweather had a boxing match against the Big Show at WrestleMania 24, and most recently Bad Bunny appeared in a tag team match at WrestleMania 37. This is the match most non-wrestling fans may tune in to see as Paul steps into his second WrestleMania match to date.Hosted by WWE superstar and NBA celebrity all-star standout Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin, celebrities from all across the entertainment world will be set to make WrestleMania appearances like Snoop Dogg, Becky G, and Jimmie Allen. Those are just the ones that have been announced but WrestleMania is built on surprise so one should be on the lookout for more.Speaking of celebrity wrestlers in Hollywood, John Cena, a 16-time world champion and star of HBO's Peacemaker, is set for a WWE United States Championship match against Austin Theory. Cena is slowly ramping down his pro wrestling career as he settles into his acting career ala Dwayne Johnson and Dave Bautista.

It is WWE's biggest, longest-running, and most successful pay-per-view/live-streaming event since its conception by executive chairman Vince McMahon in 1985. For many fans and wrestlers, however, it's basically the Superbowl. It's March Madness. The Masters, the NBA Championship, and the World Series. It's the be-all, end-all of professional wrestling. As such, WWE puts a lot of investment and spectacle into making each WrestleMania as memorable as the lastThe event takes place between mid-March and early April each year, with the company bringing together its best wrestlers (or superstars as the company refers to them as), legends, and celebrities in front of a massive audience of millions around the world watching at home or attending live.In an interview with Chuck Carroll of CBS ahead of WrestleMania 35, Becky Lynch explained what Mania and main eventing it meant to her:""I have been obsessing about this.

5bc2298d-b1bb-4934-a1eb-f26f8d766c93,"Google Bard is about to get supercharged - Google's newly-released chatbot, Bard, lacks pizazz, to say the least. The company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, addressed these concerns on the New York Times' Hard Fork podcast Thursday. While acknowledging that Bard has its weaknesses, Pichai claimed that an injection of raw power was imminent.In Mashable's own tests of Bard, the chatbot's answers could indeed be a letdown \u2014 bland and terse when what we were specifically asking for was something spicy and creative. However, in some areas we appreciated its no-nonsense explanations, and we even noticed the potential for something great in its direct-but-counterintuitive answers to tough questions.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            ChatGPT banned in Italy\n            \n\n\nPichai explained on Hard Fork, ""We knew when we were putting Bard out we wanted to be careful. It\u2019s the beginning of a journey for us. [\u2026] Since this was the first time we were putting out, we wanted to see what type of queries we would get. We obviously positioned it carefully.""And in fairness, the word ""Bard"" in the logo on the Bard homepage is followed immediately by the word ""experiment."" The blog post announcing Bard called it, ""an early experiment that lets you collaborate with generative AI."" Yet, the public didn't dial its expectations to exactly the level Pichai intended, he explained.  ""We tried to prime users to its creative collaborative queries,"" he said, ""but people do a variety of things. I think it was slightly maybe lost. [\u2026] So in some ways, we put out one of our smaller models out there, what\u2019s powering Bard. And we were careful.""Pichai likened Bard to a ""souped-up Civic"" in a race against hotter sports cars. That's an odd appeal to Google's humility that may not win your sympathies if you consider that Google has been accused by the Justice Department of monopolistic business practices, and that its parent company Alphabet is one of Fortune Magazine's top 10 most powerful companies in the world. In any case, here's the good news for all Bard fans out there: Pichai says the chatbot is about to get upgraded to a new model soon, like, really really soon. ""We clearly have more capable models. Pretty soon, maybe as this goes live, we will be upgrading Bard to some of our more capable PaLM models, so which will bring more capabilities, be it in reasoning, coding. It can answer math questions better. So you will see progress over the course of next week.""Naturally, Pichai hedged a bit, explaining that safety and user experience are of paramount concern. ""We are all in very, very early stages. We will have even more capable models to plug in over time. But I don\u2019t want it to be just who\u2019s there first, but getting it right is very important to us."" Translation: Don't expect the upgrade to burst onto the metaphorical court and dunk on the current metaphorical Lebron James of large language models: GPT-4.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nGoogle's attempts to keep expectations low in this area are probably wise, given the recent accusations that the company is training its models on outputs from ChatGPT \u2014 which Google denies. Training a large language model on outputs from someone else's large language model is a little like photocopying a map and calling yourself a cartographer \u2014 not a good look.Pichai also hinted at a not-too-distant future where powerful, personalized models exist for every user. ""In some ways, [a personalized model] is what we envisioned when we were building Google Assistant. But we have the technology to actually do those things now."" So keeping in mind that Bard is owned by the company that owns or develops the products billions of people use to organize their lives, it's probably not wise count out Google as an eventual heavy-hitter in the chatbot world.",Google Bard is about to get supercharged,"Google's newly-released chatbot, Bard, lacks pizazz, to say the least. The company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, addressed these concerns on the New York Times' Hard Fork podcast Thursday. While acknowledging that Bard has its weaknesses, Pichai claimed that an injection of raw power was imminent.In Mashable's own tests of Bard, the chatbot's answers could indeed be a letdown \u2014 bland and terse when what we were specifically asking for was something spicy and creative. However, in some areas we appreciated its no-nonsense explanations, and we even noticed the potential for something great in its direct-but-counterintuitive answers to tough questions.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            ChatGPT banned in Italy\n            \n\n\nPichai explained on Hard Fork, ""We knew when we were putting Bard out we wanted to be careful. It\u2019s the beginning of a journey for us. [\u2026] Since this was the first time we were putting out, we wanted to see what type of queries we would get. We obviously positioned it carefully.""And in fairness, the word ""Bard"" in the logo on the Bard homepage is followed immediately by the word ""experiment."" The blog post announcing Bard called it, ""an early experiment that lets you collaborate with generative AI."" Yet, the public didn't dial its expectations to exactly the level Pichai intended, he explained.  ""We tried to prime users to its creative collaborative queries,"" he said, ""but people do a variety of things. I think it was slightly maybe lost. [\u2026] So in some ways, we put out one of our smaller models out there, what\u2019s powering Bard. And we were careful.""Pichai likened Bard to a ""souped-up Civic"" in a race against hotter sports cars. That's an odd appeal to Google's humility that may not win your sympathies if you consider that Google has been accused by the Justice Department of monopolistic business practices, and that its parent company Alphabet is one of Fortune Magazine's top 10 most powerful companies in the world. In any case, here's the good news for all Bard fans out there: Pichai says the chatbot is about to get upgraded to a new model soon, like, really really soon. ""We clearly have more capable models. Pretty soon, maybe as this goes live, we will be upgrading Bard to some of our more capable PaLM models, so which will bring more capabilities, be it in reasoning, coding. It can answer math questions better. So you will see progress over the course of next week.""Naturally, Pichai hedged a bit, explaining that safety and user experience are of paramount concern. ""We are all in very, very early stages. We will have even more capable models to plug in over time. But I don\u2019t want it to be just who\u2019s there first, but getting it right is very important to us."" Translation: Don't expect the upgrade to burst onto the metaphorical court and dunk on the current metaphorical Lebron James of large language models: GPT-4.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nGoogle's attempts to keep expectations low in this area are probably wise, given the recent accusations that the company is training its models on outputs from ChatGPT \u2014 which Google denies. Training a large language model on outputs from someone else's large language model is a little like photocopying a map and calling yourself a cartographer \u2014 not a good look.Pichai also hinted at a not-too-distant future where powerful, personalized models exist for every user.

And I'm concerned for him.I'll admit it, there's plenty more about The Night Agent series to focus on: There's a mole in the White House? Who set up the Night Agent as a deep state accomplice and ruined his reputation? Who are all these shady characters, and why do they want a former tech CEO dead? But it's the principle of the thing: The Night Agent working during the day is all the evidence we need that capitalism is well and truly fucked. Call this professionally vampiric man's manager.

He's part of what's known as the ""Night Action"" team, which always makes me point finger guns at the screen whenever it's named aloud. Under the command of White House chief of staff Diane Farr (Hong Chau), Peter sits around processing paperwork and waiting for hotshot Night Agents to call the secret landline if they're in need of assistance \u2014 something he fails at the first time we see the phone ring. Three rings, Peter? You picked it up after three rings? Sir, this is the FBI. One ring.On the end of this call is cybersecurity entrepreneur and ex-CEO Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), whose connection to two Night Agents drags Peter out of the basement and into the field. Now he's a Night Agent! And he can kiss his sleeping hours and the title of the show goodbye, as he'll be required to be a Dayman ah-ah-ahhhhh! too. Which is great, but not \U0001f44f what \U0001f44f we \U0001f44f are \U0001f44f here \U0001f44f for. \n\n\n\n\nThis man has been awake for multiple days at this point, still working.\nCredit: Dan Power/Netflix\n\n\nDoes the Night Agent ever sleep?Friends, I'm concerned for the wellbeing of our eponymous hero. FBI agents need sleep like the rest of us. Dana Scully and Fox Mulder snoozed in The X-Files. Clarice Starling napped in Silence of the Lambs. Dale Cooper loved a post-memo kip in Twin Peaks. The Night Agent sees Peter staying awake for his job over several nights, keeping watch over Rose in his apartment, outside her family's cabin, just everywhere. Peter insists on staying awake; he's used to the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift after all. But the thing is, Peter always seems to do something in the day after his night shifts, which means he goes straight from an eight-hour shift to a full-on pursuit by assailants, without so much as a nap. Peter does accidentally take one nap, on the White House chief of staff's couch but it's unclear how long he's been lying there. This man needs a good night's sleep! The Night Agent is now streaming on Netflix, all day and all night. ","When 'The Night Agent' works in the day, it feels like a personal betrayal","The Night Agent has one job.

Three rings, Peter? You picked it up after three rings? Sir, this is the FBI. One ring.On the end of this call is cybersecurity entrepreneur and ex-CEO Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), whose connection to two Night Agents drags Peter out of the basement and into the field. Now he's a Night Agent! And he can kiss his sleeping hours and the title of the show goodbye, as he'll be required to be a Dayman ah-ah-ahhhhh! too. Which is great, but not \U0001f44f what \U0001f44f we \U0001f44f are \U0001f44f here \U0001f44f for. \n\n\n\n\nThis man has been awake for multiple days at this point, still working.\nCredit: Dan Power/Netflix\n\n\nDoes the Night Agent ever sleep?Friends, I'm concerned for the wellbeing of our eponymous hero. FBI agents need sleep like the rest of us. Dana Scully and Fox Mulder snoozed in The X-Files. Clarice Starling napped in Silence of the Lambs. Dale Cooper loved a post-memo kip in Twin Peaks. The Night Agent sees Peter staying awake for his job over several nights, keeping watch over Rose in his apartment, outside her family's cabin, just everywhere. Peter insists on staying awake; he's used to the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift after all. But the thing is, Peter always seems to do something in the day after his night shifts, which means he goes straight from an eight-hour shift to a full-on pursuit by assailants, without so much as a nap. Peter does accidentally take one nap, on the White House chief of staff's couch but it's unclear how long he's been lying there. This man needs a good night's sleep! The Night Agent is now streaming on Netflix, all day and all night. ",https://mashable.com/article/the-night-agent-day-netflix,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:28:18 +0000",Mashable,

Hmmmm?Just to get a sense of the most popular movies and TV shows people are streaming, we've streaming aggregator Reelgood, which gathers viewership numbers from hundreds of streaming services in the U.S. and UK. Each week, the most streamed watches come down to a few elements \u2014 sheer buzz, a big finale, smart marketing, star power, critical acclaim, or word-of-mouth that leads people to finally watch it out of spite.And this week, The Last of Us has finally been toppled after a staggeringly impressive nine weeks at the top, with John Wick taking the crown.But just because a lot of people are watching something doesn't make it...good. Here they are, the 10 most streamed TV shows and movies of the week, where to watch them, and what Mashable critics thought.1. John Wick\n\n\n\n\nDaisyyyy.\nCredit: David Lee/Thunder Road/Lionsgate/87eleven/Mjw/Summit/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\n\n""It wasn't just a puppy.""John Wick can't melee his way back onto our screens fast enough, with the fourth instalment now showing in cinemas. So, it seems everyone's going back to the start, meeting Keanu Reeves in 2014 in the first film as a hitman jolted out of retirement on a quest for revenge. Justice for Daisy. \u2014 Shannon Connellan, UK EditorHow to watch: John Wick is now streaming on Peacock. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Why 'John Wick: Chapter 4's body count matters\n            \n\n\n2. The Night Agent\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Dan Power/Netflix\n\n\nHe's an agent, who works at night. But that's not all this show is. Based on Matthew Quirk's novel and created by Shawn Ryan, The Night Agent follows low level FBI agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) who works in a windowless room in the basement of the White House under the command of White House Chief of Staff Diane Farr (Hong Chau). Peter sits around processing paperwork and waiting for hotshot Night Agents to call the secret landline if they're in need of assistance \u2014 and then one call changes it all. \u2014 S.CHow to watch: The Night Agent is now streaming on Netflix.3. Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Yeoh is up for Best Lead Actress at this year's Oscars.\nCredit: A24\n\n\nOne of the absolute best movies that 2022 had to offer, Everything Everywhere All at Once boasts a little bit of everything, from a deeply poignant mother-daughter tale to a gleefully silly thread involving a quirky one-hit wonder, to a romantic scene featuring hot dog fingers and a sprawling battle involving butt plugs. It's A24's highest-grossing film to date and it swept the Oscars this year, taking home Best Picture, Best Director, and all four acting awards.Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (aka Daniels), Everything Everywhere All at Once stars Michelle Yeoh in her most exhilarating role yet: a multiverse-hopping mom, dedicated to saving all existence but especially her on-the-edge daughter (the sensational Stephanie Hsu). Having more fun with the multiverse concept than Marvel could dare, this outrageous action-comedy giddily thrusts audiences into wild alternative worlds, brandishing unexpected weapons alongside jaw-dropping fashion and wildly captivating performances from Yeoh, Hsu, and their totally game co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis.* \u2014 Kristy Puchko, Film EditorWhat we thought: Everything Everywhere All at Once is a tornado of a movie: dizzying, filled with turns, and peppered with eye-catching elements. Yet at the core of its frenetic swirls of allusions, action sequences, and madcap mayhem, there lies a poignant parable about this ruthlessly overwhelming age. \u2014 K.P.How to watch: Everything Everywhere All at Once is now streaming on Paramount+.4. Yellowjackets\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/Showtime\n\n\nBuzz buzz buzz! Showtime's taking us back into the wilderness to pick up where we left off with the Wiskayok High School Yellowjackets soccer team, lost somewhere in the Canadian wilderness after their plane crashed on the way to Nationals. Season 1 threw plenty of mysteries at us in the past and present, with the show meeting up with the survivors of the crash 25 years later. Who might die in the wilderness in Season 2? What's the deal with all this cult stuff? Are there clues in the opening credits? Before you jump into Season 2, here's a recap of everything you need to remember from Season 1, and the burning questions we have. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Yellowjackets Season 1 was just an amuse-bouche. The excellent kickoff to Showtime's addictive series hinted at cannibalism and ritualistic sacrifice, but it's only in Season 2 that we truly get at the meat of what happened to the Yellowjackets in the wilderness. \u2014 Belen Edwards, Entertainment ReporterHow to watch: Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n\nFeatured Video For You\n\n\n\n\n'Yellowjackets' Warren Kole breaks down his epic Season 2 Papa Roach scene\n\n\n\n5. Ted Lasso\n\n\n\n\nBrett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt and Jason Sudeikis are back for ""Ted Lasso"" Season 3.\nCredit: Apple TV+\n\n\nApple TV+'s Emmy-winning comedy Ted Lasso is back for Season 3. All your favourite AFC Richmond players and staff return of course, including the eponymous hero Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis), Coach Beard (Brendan Hunt), Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein), Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster), Isaac McAdoo (Kola Bokinni), Sam Obisanya's (Toheeb Jimoh), Dani Rojas (Cristo Fern\xe1ndez), Higgins (Jeremy Swift), Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham), and Keeley (Juno Temple). \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Just as football continues to be life, so too does Ted Lasso continue to be its charming, heartwarming (and occasionally heartbreaking) self in Season 3. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: Ted Lasso is now streaming on Apple TV+.6. Succession\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\n\n\nThe wait for Succession Season 4 can fuck off. After a diabolical Season 3, the latest and final season of Jesse Armstrong's award-winning series is here, and the Roy siblings Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin) are geared up to challenge their newly estranged father Logan (Brian Vox) in the media game. Everything is on the table this season. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Jesse Armstrong's Emmy-winning drama takes no prisoners in its fourth and final season. It's as unsparing and sharp as its predecessors, yet somehow manages to up the show's audacity to new heights. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: Succession Season 4, episode 1 is streaming now on HBO Max, with new episodes airing weekly on Sundays at 9 p.m.7. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Mark Rogers / Lionsgate\n\n\nDirector Chad Stahelski's Keanu Reeves-fronted action thriller franchise gets another spot in the most streamed this week, with folks catching up on everything that happened in the instalment before John Wick: Chapter 4. In John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, our hero is deemed ""excommunicado"" for an unauthorised killing of a High Table crime lord. So, he calls in a favour from an old friend and assassin, Sofia Al-Azwar (Halle Berry). There's plenty of animal involvement here, especially from Sofia's highly skilled dogs.How to watch: John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is now streaming on Peacock Premium.8. Boston Strangler\n\n\n\n\nCarrie Coon and Keira Knightley as Jean Cole and Loretta McLaughlin.\nCredit: Disney/Hulu\n\n\nAnother day, another true crime adaptation. This time, Kiera Knightley is in the lead as Boston Record American journalist Loretta McLaughlin, who investigated and reported on a string of murders in Boston in the 1960s. McLaughlin broke the story with fellow journalist Jean Cole, played by Carrie Coon. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Ruskin's execution of his ""inspired by true events"" narrative seems less like a feminist historical thriller in the vein of Hidden Figures or She Said, and more a clumsy and ghoulish imitation of David Fincher's seminal Zodiac. The resulting film is a crime against cinema on several counts. \u2014 K.P.How to watch: Boston Stranger is now streaming on Hulu.9. The Last of Us\n\n\n\n\nThis sequence tho \U0001f62d\nCredit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\n\n\nIt's been the one to beat and no one has until this week. The Last of Us was the most streamed of the week for nine weeks running, right up until the finale. Chernobyl director Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann bring the lauded Naughty Dog survival adventure game to the screen, with a deeply moving, stunt-packed, superbly scripted, and powerfully performed television show. Pedro Pascal takes the lead as Joel Miller, a man living in a post-apocalyptic America in 2023 amidst a pandemic caused by the Cordyceps fungus, which turns regular humans into monsters. He's tasked with bringing 14-year-old Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, across the country on a mission, but there's more than monsters that stand between them and their destination. Fans will be especially thrilled to see how HBO's The Last of Us masterfully weaves in the game mechanics, but they'll have to keep on their toes for new inclusions, clues, and breadcrumbs. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Making a TV show that lives up to the source material is always a high bar to clear, but especially so in this case. Luckily for gamers and new viewers alike, The Last of Us leaps over it with room to spare, chasing excellence with the boundless energy of a Clicker hunting its prey. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: The Last of Us airs at 9 p.m. ET every Sunday on HBO and HBO Max.10. Swarm\n\n\n\n\nDre (Dominique Fishback) is a mega fan.\nCredit: Prime Video\n\n\nThe new collaboration between creators and executive producers Janine Nabers and Donald Glover, Swarm is a tale of obsessive fandom and murder. The Prime Video series follows Dre (Dominique Fishback), a superfan fan of pop star Ni'Jah, whose life takes a chaotic, dark turn.

Each week, the most streamed watches come down to a few elements \u2014 sheer buzz, a big finale, smart marketing, star power, critical acclaim, or word-of-mouth that leads people to finally watch it out of spite.And this week, The Last of Us has finally been toppled after a staggeringly impressive nine weeks at the top, with John Wick taking the crown.But just because a lot of people are watching something doesn't make it...good. Here they are, the 10 most streamed TV shows and movies of the week, where to watch them, and what Mashable critics thought.1.

So, it seems everyone's going back to the start, meeting Keanu Reeves in 2014 in the first film as a hitman jolted out of retirement on a quest for revenge.

The Night Agent\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Dan Power/Netflix\n\n\nHe's an agent, who works at night. But that's not all this show is. Based on Matthew Quirk's novel and created by Shawn Ryan, The Night Agent follows low level FBI agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) who works in a windowless room in the basement of the White House under the command of White House Chief of Staff Diane Farr (Hong Chau). Peter sits around processing paperwork and waiting for hotshot Night Agents to call the secret landline if they're in need of assistance \u2014 and then one call changes it all. \u2014 S.CHow to watch: The Night Agent is now streaming on Netflix.3. Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Yeoh is up for Best Lead Actress at this year's Oscars.\nCredit: A24\n\n\nOne of the absolute best movies that 2022 had to offer, Everything Everywhere All at Once boasts a little bit of everything, from a deeply poignant mother-daughter tale to a gleefully silly thread involving a quirky one-hit wonder, to a romantic scene featuring hot dog fingers and a sprawling battle involving butt plugs. It's A24's highest-grossing film to date and it swept the Oscars this year, taking home Best Picture, Best Director, and all four acting awards.Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (aka Daniels), Everything Everywhere All at Once stars Michelle Yeoh in her most exhilarating role yet: a multiverse-hopping mom, dedicated to saving all existence but especially her on-the-edge daughter (the sensational Stephanie Hsu). Having more fun with the multiverse concept than Marvel could dare, this outrageous action-comedy giddily thrusts audiences into wild alternative worlds, brandishing unexpected weapons alongside jaw-dropping fashion and wildly captivating performances from Yeoh, Hsu, and their totally game co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis.* \u2014 Kristy Puchko, Film EditorWhat we thought: Everything Everywhere All at Once is a tornado of a movie: dizzying, filled with turns, and peppered with eye-catching elements. Yet at the core of its frenetic swirls of allusions, action sequences, and madcap mayhem, there lies a poignant parable about this ruthlessly overwhelming age. \u2014 K.P.How to watch: Everything Everywhere All at Once is now streaming on Paramount+.4. Yellowjackets\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/Showtime\n\n\nBuzz buzz buzz! Showtime's taking us back into the wilderness to pick up where we left off with the Wiskayok High School Yellowjackets soccer team, lost somewhere in the Canadian wilderness after their plane crashed on the way to Nationals. Season 1 threw plenty of mysteries at us in the past and present, with the show meeting up with the survivors of the crash 25 years later. Who might die in the wilderness in Season 2? What's the deal with all this cult stuff? Are there clues in the opening credits? Before you jump into Season 2, here's a recap of everything you need to remember from Season 1, and the burning questions we have. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Yellowjackets Season 1 was just an amuse-bouche. The excellent kickoff to Showtime's addictive series hinted at cannibalism and ritualistic sacrifice, but it's only in Season 2 that we truly get at the meat of what happened to the Yellowjackets in the wilderness. \u2014 Belen Edwards, Entertainment ReporterHow to watch: Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n\nFeatured Video For You\n\n\n\n\n'Yellowjackets' Warren Kole breaks down his epic Season 2 Papa Roach scene\n\n\n\n5. Ted Lasso\n\n\n\n\nBrett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt and Jason Sudeikis are back for ""Ted Lasso"" Season 3.\nCredit: Apple TV+\n\n\nApple TV+'s Emmy-winning comedy Ted Lasso is back for Season 3. All your favourite AFC Richmond players and staff return of course, including the eponymous hero Ted Lasso (Jason Sudeikis), Coach Beard (Brendan Hunt), Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein), Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster), Isaac McAdoo (Kola Bokinni), Sam Obisanya's (Toheeb Jimoh), Dani Rojas (Cristo Fern\xe1ndez), Higgins (Jeremy Swift), Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham), and Keeley (Juno Temple). \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Just as football continues to be life, so too does Ted Lasso continue to be its charming, heartwarming (and occasionally heartbreaking) self in Season 3. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: Ted Lasso is now streaming on Apple TV+.6. Succession\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\n\n\nThe wait for Succession Season 4 can fuck off. After a diabolical Season 3, the latest and final season of Jesse Armstrong's award-winning series is here, and the Roy siblings Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin) are geared up to challenge their newly estranged father Logan (Brian Vox) in the media game. Everything is on the table this season. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Jesse Armstrong's Emmy-winning drama takes no prisoners in its fourth and final season. It's as unsparing and sharp as its predecessors, yet somehow manages to up the show's audacity to new heights. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: Succession Season 4, episode 1 is streaming now on HBO Max, with new episodes airing weekly on Sundays at 9 p.m.7. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Mark Rogers / Lionsgate\n\n\nDirector Chad Stahelski's Keanu Reeves-fronted action thriller franchise gets another spot in the most streamed this week, with folks catching up on everything that happened in the instalment before John Wick: Chapter 4. In John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, our hero is deemed ""excommunicado"" for an unauthorised killing of a High Table crime lord. So, he calls in a favour from an old friend and assassin, Sofia Al-Azwar (Halle Berry). There's plenty of animal involvement here, especially from Sofia's highly skilled dogs.How to watch: John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is now streaming on Peacock Premium.8. Boston Strangler\n\n\n\n\nCarrie Coon and Keira Knightley as Jean Cole and Loretta McLaughlin.\nCredit: Disney/Hulu\n\n\nAnother day, another true crime adaptation. This time, Kiera Knightley is in the lead as Boston Record American journalist Loretta McLaughlin, who investigated and reported on a string of murders in Boston in the 1960s. McLaughlin broke the story with fellow journalist Jean Cole, played by Carrie Coon. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Ruskin's execution of his ""inspired by true events"" narrative seems less like a feminist historical thriller in the vein of Hidden Figures or She Said, and more a clumsy and ghoulish imitation of David Fincher's seminal Zodiac. The resulting film is a crime against cinema on several counts. \u2014 K.P.How to watch: Boston Stranger is now streaming on Hulu.9. The Last of Us\n\n\n\n\nThis sequence tho \U0001f62d\nCredit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\n\n\nIt's been the one to beat and no one has until this week. The Last of Us was the most streamed of the week for nine weeks running, right up until the finale. Chernobyl director Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann bring the lauded Naughty Dog survival adventure game to the screen, with a deeply moving, stunt-packed, superbly scripted, and powerfully performed television show. Pedro Pascal takes the lead as Joel Miller, a man living in a post-apocalyptic America in 2023 amidst a pandemic caused by the Cordyceps fungus, which turns regular humans into monsters. He's tasked with bringing 14-year-old Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, across the country on a mission, but there's more than monsters that stand between them and their destination. Fans will be especially thrilled to see how HBO's The Last of Us masterfully weaves in the game mechanics, but they'll have to keep on their toes for new inclusions, clues, and breadcrumbs. \u2014 S.C.What we thought: Making a TV show that lives up to the source material is always a high bar to clear, but especially so in this case. Luckily for gamers and new viewers alike, The Last of Us leaps over it with room to spare, chasing excellence with the boundless energy of a Clicker hunting its prey. \u2014 B.E.How to watch: The Last of Us airs at 9 p.m. ET every Sunday on HBO and HBO Max.10. Swarm\n\n\n\n\nDre (Dominique Fishback) is a mega fan.\nCredit: Prime Video\n\n\nThe new collaboration between creators and executive producers Janine Nabers and Donald Glover, Swarm is a tale of obsessive fandom and murder. The Prime Video series follows Dre (Dominique Fishback), a superfan fan of pop star Ni'Jah, whose life takes a chaotic, dark turn. It's also Billie Eilish's acting debut. \u2014 S.C.How to watch: Swarm is now streaming on Prime Video.* Asterisks indicate the writeup is adapted from another Mashable article.",https://mashable.com/article/top-streaming-most-popular-tv-shows-movies,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:53:53 +0000",Mashable,
7cda37b8-855a-4f98-bb3c-fb4d4f4b1377,"How to spice up your sex life when you have endometriosis - Sex, for many of us with chronic pain conditions and disabilities, is not a straight-forward thing. Issues such as dyspareunia (the medical term for painful penetration), low libido, discomfort, irregular bleeding are all potential reasons for this, and all of which can be caused by the same culprit \u2014 endometriosis.Endometriosis is a condition which causes cells similar to the ones in the lining of the uterus to grow elsewhere in the body and is estimated to impact one in ten people assigned female at birth. These cells react in the same way as those within the uterus, building up throughout the month and eventually breaking down as blood. However, unlike the cells within the uterus that leave the body as a period, this bleeding has no way of escaping, therefore causing a variety of issues ranging from chronic pain, fatigue, and depression, to fertility issues, wider social complications (such as one\u2019s ability to fulfil work, social commitments, and relationship needs) and, in some cases, organ damage.\xa058 percent of people with endometriosis feel that it has impacted their sex drive, and 54 percent believed that this had damaged their relationships with sexual partners, according to LoveHoney data shared with Mashable. Of the 38 percent of people surveyed who had not not spoken to a doctor about this, 30 percent shared that they did not know who to speak to, or could not bring themselves to talk about it. A further 20 percent had given up any hope of finding a solution.

I began prostap while on the waiting list for surgery, in attempts to prevent my endometriosis from worsening during my waiting time.Broaden your views of what 'counts' as sex Sex can become an incredibly alienating topic when it comes to endometriosis, especially when general understandings of sex are confined to heteronormative views on what does or does not \u2018count\u2019. Standard penetrative sex can be an incredibly painful experience for women and non-binary people with the condition, which can lead to feelings of guilt and insecurity within an individual. We ask ourselves: ""Is it supposed to feel like this?"" ""Am I doing something wrong?"" ""Why does it look so much easier for everyone else?"" But what we should really be asking is, ""if this doesn\u2019t work for me, what does?""On-screen portrayals often depict sex as the most intimate experience we can share with another person, making it seem like a key, non-negotiable and easily obtainable part of romantic relationships. However, this is not always the case. Mainstream pornography and heteronormative sex scenes in films and television shows have largely dictated that sex should look and be a certain way \u2014 usually involving penis-in-vagina (PIV) sex and favouring positions like missionary and doggy style. In reality, these positions are not accessible or enjoyable for many of us.\xa0\n    Sex is much more than just penetration.\n    \nReproductive health scientist and sex educator Zoya Ali shared some accurate and accessible advice for people with endometriosis when it comes to improving our sex lives. ""The first thing I would like to address is that sex is much more than just penetration,"" Ali told Mashable. ""Pleasure should be the goal of sex. Working on figuring out what pleasure means for you could help add to intimacy in partnered sex.""She also emphasised that pain with sex is a particularly common symptom of endometriosis. ""This pain will vary for everyone. For some, it might not even happen. Some might only experience mild pain, while others have reported it to feel like a stabbing shooting pain.""\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            12 sex tips for disabled people and their partners\n            \n\n\nThis pain can be impacted by the locations of the\xa0endometrial lesions, as penetration can cause irritation and inflammation. In short, there is no textbook way to experience endometriosis-related pain during sex, as it impacts individuals so uniquely. For some, orgasms can actually trigger their flare ups, so finding out what is comfortable for you needs to be a completely individualistic approach.\xa0When it comes to penetrative positions, I have always had a love-hate relationship with missionary and spooning. Before my first surgery, missionary was essentially impossible, with spooning being an easier alternative. Four years on, and two surgeries later, spooning causes me intense discomfort, and missionary, while still uncomfortable at times, can actually be enjoyable on a good pain day.

Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.It would seem that sometimes, it really is more about the motion of the ocean. ""Focusing on shallower. slower penetration or non-penetrative sex can help ease the pain,"" Ali tells Mashable. ""Usually, the depth, angle, and pace of penetration in a certain position would be what is causing you pain. Any position that shortens the vaginal canal or involves deep penetration, like doggy style, could become painful. Good old missionary can also be painful because of how the uterus gets positioned during intercourse.""\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            What is pelvic pain and what can you do to treat it?\n            \n\n\nClinical Sexologist and Therapist Ness Cooper echoed these views, adding that: ""If other organs are affected by endo, it can be hard to recommend a specific position that would help without knowing the individual's pain areas."" They recommend trying baths, heat pads, or even switching on a heated blanket before getting intimate. This may even make it easier to orgasm, as heat helps to promote a good blood flow throughout the body.\n    Focusing on shallower. slower penetration or non-penetrative sex can help ease the pain.\n    \nWhile not every penetrative position will work for everyone with endometriosis, here are some tips and tricks that Ali and Cooper suggest.To penetrate, or not to penetrate\u2026\xa0Missionary doesn\u2019t have to be a lost cause \u2014 sometimes we just need to approach things from a different angle\u2026 literally. Adding pillows or blankets under your hips for additional support has been reported to reduce the pain associated with positions such as this, which is a win for those of us who miss the intimacy of this position.\xa0Ali added: ""OhNut is a great product to consider for this. It is made of stackable silicone rings that can be worn on the penis and act as a physical barrier to control penetration depth.""Cooper adds that cock rings may also be helpful for penis-in-vagina penetration in positions that affect the cervix and vaginal canal, as they act as buffers to reduce the penetrable length of the penis.It is key to bear in mind, though, that penetration is not the be-all-or-end-all of sex. Oral sex, fingering, and mutual masturbation are just as important and enjoyable \u2014 and often much less painful.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            The gender health gap makes people's lives hell\n            \n\n\nAli shares: ""The entire body is capable of being stimulated and pleased. Research has shown that most people prefer some form of clitoral stimulation either alongside or instead of penetration to be able to orgasm.""\xa0Both Cooper and Ali suggested massages as a great way of improving intimacy while also soothing pain. ""Mapping out and discovering erogenous zones in your body. We sometimes also forget how sexy kissing, touching, and cuddling can get, so don\u2019t forget to spend generous amounts of time doing that.""\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Your ultimate guide to breast play\xa0\n            \n\n\nCooper adds: ""Seated sex toys such as the Ruby Glow may provide enjoyable external pleasure and orgasms, whilst the pressure of the sex toy also can feel comfortable even to those with pudendal nerves discomfort or pubis synthesis.""Giving mutual masturbation a go can also be insightful \u2014 this way, you are completely in control of the experience, and can navigate your orgasm with full knowledge of what hurts you, and what does not. Masturbating together gives you the freedom to be in total control of your pleasure, so you can navigate your pain while still being intimate with your partner. In doing this, you can also show your partner how you want to be touched.Finally, though most importantly, addressing your sexual boundaries with sexual partners \u2014new and old \u2014 is essential. What's off limits for now, or forever? What are you open to trying at some point? Talking about sex can be daunting at the best of times, and endometriosis related struggles can make this more of a challenge. It's important that these conversations happen in a neutral space, outside of the bedroom, at a time when you're not on the cusp of tumbling into bed together.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            How to perform cunnilingus like a pro\n            \n\n\n""It can be a challenging conversation, especially with a new partner,"" Ali shares, ""but effective communication is very important when it comes to partnered sex. Opening up to your partner(s) about what you like and dislike can help make it a more supported, pleasurable and intimate experience for you all.""By not opening up to your partner, you are putting yourself through unnecessary pain and dealing with it in silence, which, in the long run, could cause hesitation to have sex and ultimately impact your intimate relationship.""We often overthink the number of times people are having sex during a week, month and even day. When in fact most individuals have sex less than 10 times a month, and some only once a week,"" Cooper shared. It is normal to not want sex all of the time, and for couples to sometimes have mismatched sex drives, especially when endometriosis pain and flare-ups are in the mix.Cooper emphasises that it is incredibly important that, ""if a partner is making you feel guilty about setting boundaries and not wanting sex, it is key to explore the reasons behind why they feel it\u2019s important and the emotions behind that.""How can you come to terms with your own boundaries, then, and put them into action?\xa0Mix up your sex positions As the saying goes, you don\u2019t know until you try. It\u2019s important to try new things at your own pace, as this will help you recognise which angles and positions are causing you discomfort.Ali explains: ""Spooning on your side allows you to control the depth of penetration. Since your partner will be penetrating you from behind, it allows for shallow penetration. It also allows your partner to give some loving to the clitoris either with their hands or using toys.""Getting on top is also worth a try! Positions like the seated lotus or reverse cowgirl allow you to control the depth of penetration and set the pace of the thrusting movement, which is a great way to explore your limits and better understand what is causing your pain. Depending on where your endo and pain is, Doggystyle can also allow for shallow penetration, which is less likely to cause irritation.Keep track of your pain and pick up on triggersKeeping track of patterns and triggers you notice in the correlation between sex and pain is incredibly valuable. ""Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. Was it during, before or after penetration? Was it a certain specific position? Was it at a certain time in your cycle? Did something like lube help?""You might notice specific points in your cycle when your symptoms flare up. Some people report feeling more pain around the middle and end of their cycle or while on their period.\xa0\n    Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. \n    \nCooper told Mashable that ""heated sex toys are probably one of my favourite and most successful recommendations, followed by seated sex toys, and sex position pillows and straps.""They acknowledge that finding ways to work with chronic pain conditions in the bedroom can be an expensive and draining journey, so it is key to explore as many inexpensive options as you can at different stages of your cycle. What works when you are flaring? What feels good when your pain is a 6/10? What about when you\u2019re having a good day?Ali adds that: ""Bloating can also be a cause of pain. If you find certain foods trigger your bloating, try avoiding them before you are looking to have sex.""Ease into itIf you find that the idea of sex is making you anxious, it\u2019s important to address these feelings \u2014 you can\u2019t expect your body to relax if your mind is racing. ""You don\u2019t have to rush directly into penetration [particularly in penis-to-vagina sex]. Focus on getting yourself aroused and building up to it to give your body time to lubricate naturally, making penetration easier,"" concludes Ali.It\u2019s important to give yourself time, as the anxiety you are feeling might actually be adding to your pain. Easing into it will help relax your nerves. Ali suggests: ""Take a warm shower together, light up some candles, put on your favourite playlist, whatever gets you going!""Use lots of lubeIt\u2019s important to be generous with lube, because a lack of lubrication can cause friction and pain. ""Vaginal dryness can happen with age, hormonal imbalances, certain medications, such as hormonal contraception (which is often prescribed for endometriosis), not being aroused enough etc,"" says Ali. Seek supportFinding support, in whatever form that might take, is invaluable when you have a chronic illness. Online communities have been invaluable for me when it has come to navigating my endometriosis \u2014 whether it\u2019s asking questions, needing advice, or just generally wanting to speak to someone who understands, I have always felt welcomed and heard.Endometriosis UK has some great resources, including local support groups with regular meets (both online and in person), and a variety of blogs to read \u2014 including my own blog on sex and endometriosis.\xa0\xa0Ali said: ""If you find that your mental health is also impacting your sex life, you could consider attending counselling or sex therapy yourself or as a couple to navigate your feelings around it and improve communication.""""You could also try and explore the option of pelvic floor physiotherapy to understand the cause of the pain and help navigate it.""The beauty of sex is that it's something we can make completely our own. No one outside of our individual bubbles will know of the intimacy we share with our partner(s), the ways we do it, or the ways we enjoy it. Endometriosis and other chronic pain conditions are not a death sentence for our sex lives \u2014 they are merely one of the many elements we must consider in order to understand ourselves and our partners. It is time that we stopped aimlessly following the \u2018rules\u2019 on how sex should be, and allow ourselves to explore, experience, and enjoy sex on our own terms.",How to spice up your sex life when you have endometriosis,"Sex, for many of us with chronic pain conditions and disabilities, is not a straight-forward thing.

Adding pillows or blankets under your hips for additional support has been reported to reduce the pain associated with positions such as this, which is a win for those of us who miss the intimacy of this position.\xa0Ali added: ""OhNut is a great product to consider for this. It is made of stackable silicone rings that can be worn on the penis and act as a physical barrier to control penetration depth.""Cooper adds that cock rings may also be helpful for penis-in-vagina penetration in positions that affect the cervix and vaginal canal, as they act as buffers to reduce the penetrable length of the penis.It is key to bear in mind, though, that penetration is not the be-all-or-end-all of sex. Oral sex, fingering, and mutual masturbation are just as important and enjoyable \u2014 and often much less painful.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            The gender health gap makes people's lives hell\n            \n\n\nAli shares: ""The entire body is capable of being stimulated and pleased. Research has shown that most people prefer some form of clitoral stimulation either alongside or instead of penetration to be able to orgasm.""\xa0Both Cooper and Ali suggested massages as a great way of improving intimacy while also soothing pain. ""Mapping out and discovering erogenous zones in your body. We sometimes also forget how sexy kissing, touching, and cuddling can get, so don\u2019t forget to spend generous amounts of time doing that.""\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Your ultimate guide to breast play\xa0\n            \n\n\nCooper adds: ""Seated sex toys such as the Ruby Glow may provide enjoyable external pleasure and orgasms, whilst the pressure of the sex toy also can feel comfortable even to those with pudendal nerves discomfort or pubis synthesis.""Giving mutual masturbation a go can also be insightful \u2014 this way, you are completely in control of the experience, and can navigate your orgasm with full knowledge of what hurts you, and what does not. Masturbating together gives you the freedom to be in total control of your pleasure, so you can navigate your pain while still being intimate with your partner. In doing this, you can also show your partner how you want to be touched.Finally, though most importantly, addressing your sexual boundaries with sexual partners \u2014new and old \u2014 is essential. What's off limits for now, or forever? What are you open to trying at some point? Talking about sex can be daunting at the best of times, and endometriosis related struggles can make this more of a challenge. It's important that these conversations happen in a neutral space, outside of the bedroom, at a time when you're not on the cusp of tumbling into bed together.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            How to perform cunnilingus like a pro\n            \n\n\n""It can be a challenging conversation, especially with a new partner,"" Ali shares, ""but effective communication is very important when it comes to partnered sex. Opening up to your partner(s) about what you like and dislike can help make it a more supported, pleasurable and intimate experience for you all.""By not opening up to your partner, you are putting yourself through unnecessary pain and dealing with it in silence, which, in the long run, could cause hesitation to have sex and ultimately impact your intimate relationship.""We often overthink the number of times people are having sex during a week, month and even day. When in fact most individuals have sex less than 10 times a month, and some only once a week,"" Cooper shared. It is normal to not want sex all of the time, and for couples to sometimes have mismatched sex drives, especially when endometriosis pain and flare-ups are in the mix.Cooper emphasises that it is incredibly important that, ""if a partner is making you feel guilty about setting boundaries and not wanting sex, it is key to explore the reasons behind why they feel it\u2019s important and the emotions behind that.""How can you come to terms with your own boundaries, then, and put them into action?\xa0Mix up your sex positions As the saying goes, you don\u2019t know until you try. It\u2019s important to try new things at your own pace, as this will help you recognise which angles and positions are causing you discomfort.Ali explains: ""Spooning on your side allows you to control the depth of penetration. Since your partner will be penetrating you from behind, it allows for shallow penetration. It also allows your partner to give some loving to the clitoris either with their hands or using toys.""Getting on top is also worth a try! Positions like the seated lotus or reverse cowgirl allow you to control the depth of penetration and set the pace of the thrusting movement, which is a great way to explore your limits and better understand what is causing your pain. Depending on where your endo and pain is, Doggystyle can also allow for shallow penetration, which is less likely to cause irritation.Keep track of your pain and pick up on triggersKeeping track of patterns and triggers you notice in the correlation between sex and pain is incredibly valuable. ""Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. Was it during, before or after penetration? Was it a certain specific position? Was it at a certain time in your cycle? Did something like lube help?""You might notice specific points in your cycle when your symptoms flare up. Some people report feeling more pain around the middle and end of their cycle or while on their period.\xa0\n    Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. \n    \nCooper told Mashable that ""heated sex toys are probably one of my favourite and most successful recommendations, followed by seated sex toys, and sex position pillows and straps.""They acknowledge that finding ways to work with chronic pain conditions in the bedroom can be an expensive and draining journey, so it is key to explore as many inexpensive options as you can at different stages of your cycle. What works when you are flaring? What feels good when your pain is a 6/10? What about when you\u2019re having a good day?Ali adds that: ""Bloating can also be a cause of pain. If you find certain foods trigger your bloating, try avoiding them before you are looking to have sex.""Ease into itIf you find that the idea of sex is making you anxious, it\u2019s important to address these feelings \u2014 you can\u2019t expect your body to relax if your mind is racing. ""You don\u2019t have to rush directly into penetration [particularly in penis-to-vagina sex]. Focus on getting yourself aroused and building up to it to give your body time to lubricate naturally, making penetration easier,"" concludes Ali.It\u2019s important to give yourself time, as the anxiety you are feeling might actually be adding to your pain. Easing into it will help relax your nerves. Ali suggests: ""Take a warm shower together, light up some candles, put on your favourite playlist, whatever gets you going!""Use lots of lubeIt\u2019s important to be generous with lube, because a lack of lubrication can cause friction and pain. ""Vaginal dryness can happen with age, hormonal imbalances, certain medications, such as hormonal contraception (which is often prescribed for endometriosis), not being aroused enough etc,"" says Ali. Seek supportFinding support, in whatever form that might take, is invaluable when you have a chronic illness. Online communities have been invaluable for me when it has come to navigating my endometriosis \u2014 whether it\u2019s asking questions, needing advice, or just generally wanting to speak to someone who understands, I have always felt welcomed and heard.Endometriosis UK has some great resources, including local support groups with regular meets (both online and in person), and a variety of blogs to read \u2014 including my own blog on sex and endometriosis.\xa0\xa0Ali said: ""If you find that your mental health is also impacting your sex life, you could consider attending counselling or sex therapy yourself or as a couple to navigate your feelings around it and improve communication.""""You could also try and explore the option of pelvic floor physiotherapy to understand the cause of the pain and help navigate it.""The beauty of sex is that it's something we can make completely our own. No one outside of our individual bubbles will know of the intimacy we share with our partner(s), the ways we do it, or the ways we enjoy it. Endometriosis and other chronic pain conditions are not a death sentence for our sex lives \u2014 they are merely one of the many elements we must consider in order to understand ourselves and our partners. It is time that we stopped aimlessly following the \u2018rules\u2019 on how sex should be, and allow ourselves to explore, experience, and enjoy sex on our own terms.",https://mashable.com/article/endometriosis-sex-tips,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:50:15 +0000",Mashable,

Why vacuum regularly when you can have a robot handle it for you? Better yet, why empty the dirt and debris out of said vacuum when the robot can do it on its own? The only problem is, self-emptying vacuums aren't always the most affordable models. Some of the best robot vacuums are those that include this great perk. Luckily, one of the cheaper options is on sale now at a price you won't want to pass up. The Walmart-exclusive iRobot Roomba i1+ is on sale right now for $249.99, which is $38 less than its normal price of $288. Given that the iRobot Roomba i1 is $229.99, you're essentially getting the self-emptying dock as a bonus for just $20. The i1+ is, for all intents and purposes, Walmart's answer to the iRobot i3+, which is still $349.99 at Amazon. All that to say, this is a great deal, especially if you hate to get your hands dirty!This Roomba is an expert at cleaning all types of floors, with a three-stage loose and lift system to help you clear debris out of your carpet. It has a battery life of about 75 minutes, and after that, it'll return to its dock to empty all the nasties it collected while on the prowl in your home. You don't need to empty the main reservoir on the dock for up to 60 days, which is great news for anyone who hates cleaning. There are a few bells and whistles you can expect from the pricier models missing, like smart home mapping, but you still get app-controlled scheduling and smart suggestions that you'll want to take advantage. And for the price, you really can't beat this model. Snap it up while it's still available.

The only problem is, self-emptying vacuums aren't always the most affordable models. Some of the best robot vacuums are those that include this great perk. Luckily, one of the cheaper options is on sale now at a price you won't want to pass up. The Walmart-exclusive iRobot Roomba i1+ is on sale right now for $249.99, which is $38 less than its normal price of $288. Given that the iRobot Roomba i1 is $229.99, you're essentially getting the self-emptying dock as a bonus for just $20. The i1+ is, for all intents and purposes, Walmart's answer to the iRobot i3+, which is still $349.99 at Amazon. All that to say, this is a great deal, especially if you hate to get your hands dirty!This Roomba is an expert at cleaning all types of floors, with a three-stage loose and lift system to help you clear debris out of your carpet. It has a battery life of about 75 minutes, and after that, it'll return to its dock to empty all the nasties it collected while on the prowl in your home. You don't need to empty the main reservoir on the dock for up to 60 days, which is great news for anyone who hates cleaning. There are a few bells and whistles you can expect from the pricier models missing, like smart home mapping, but you still get app-controlled scheduling and smart suggestions that you'll want to take advantage. And for the price, you really can't beat this model. Snap it up while it's still available. ",https://mashable.com/deals/march-31-roomba-i1-plus,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:06:20 +0000",Mashable,

From the proposed TikTok ban to hearings on Section 230 (which protects social platforms from being liable for what users post), some U.S. lawmakers are targeting access to free and open internet.\xa0Recent age-verification bills are another iteration of this. These laws require people to show proof of age to view adult content \u2014 or, in some versions, to peruse social media at all. Experts warn that these bills threaten digital privacy and free speech.What are age-verification bills?Last year, Louisiana passed Act 440, which requires visitors to sites with over 33.33 percent of adult content to use a commercial age-verification system (AVS) to prove they're over 18, such as with a government-issued ID. The law went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.An influx of similar bills cropped up across the country afterwards. Utah's SB 287, which requires a commercial AVS for sites that have ""a substantial portion of material that may be harmful to minors"" has been signed into law and will go into effect on May 2. (Utah has also passed two other bills, SB 152 and HB 311, which requires age verification for all users on social media sites; parental permission to access social media for those under 18; and social media curfews for under-18s. These are supposed to go into effect in March 2024, but social media platforms are expected to challenge these laws beforehand).Copycats of the Louisiana law have also passed in Virginia, Mississippi, and Arkansas as well, but have yet to be signed. Such bills have been brought forward in other states too, like Texas and Arizona. The Free Speech Coalition, a porn industry lobby group, has compiled a tracker of age-verification bills.\xa0In the UK, similar legislation that called for age-verification on porn sites, known as the ""porn block,"" failed in 2019. Last year, the UK government revisited the idea, with critics saying it would cause a ""slippery slope"" for censorship.The downsides to ""porn passport"" lawsWhile these bills may initially seem sound \u2014 no one wants children to access adult content \u2014 the experts say that they won't work, and will cause a host of problems.In terms of the former, these statutes are difficult to enforce and easy to get around. For one, there are going to be websites based in other countries that won't comply with these regulations, said Mike Stabile, director of public affairs at the Free Speech Coalition. ""My greatest fear when I looked at [these bills] was that this is\u2026going to push kids to more and more dangerous sites,"" he said.For another, software like VPNs (virtual privacy networks) are built to make it seem like the user is somewhere they're not.

Since there aren't systems in place to implement these regulations, tech companies will scramble to respond to these laws.

If all these bills went into effect, many people wouldn't be able to access the internet at all without an ID.

There's lots of content beyond porn that's not appropriate for kids \u2014 portrayals of violence, for example \u2014 and it may be impossible to protect kids from seeing any of it, but you can talk to them about it.\xa0Beyond conversations, Stabile recommends device-level filters that block all websites that are registered RTA, or ""Restricted to Adults."" ""It signals to filters, whether it's your Apple filter or Net Nanny or something like that, that this site should be blocked,"" he explained. It doesn't matter if a child tries a VPN or some other workaround \u2014 the site will be blocked on that device.\xa0The idea behind these bills ""is not wrong,"" said Evans \u2014 no one, especially those in the adult industry, wants children watching their content. These bills, however, create risks, and can cascade into an online privacy and censorship nightmare that hurts sex workers and other internet users.\xa0""If even a few of them [age-verification bills] pass in different contexts, it will be dangerous for everyone in the United States who goes online,"" Kelley warned, ""because we will not be able to access things privately.""",https://mashable.com/article/what-are-age-verification-bills-porn-louisiana-utah,"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 10:29:02 +0000",Mashable,

It comes with collagen tablets that you're meant to add into the machine along with water and your desired fruit and/or vegetable liquids. The machine mixes all of the ingredients together, then spews out the blend into the attached mold (which is shaped like a sheet mask with cutouts for your nose and mouth) for it to cool. Eventually, after five minutes, the mixture solidifies in its tray and resembles a sheet mask (without the sheet). Texture-wise, it's a cross between a hydrogel mask and Jell-O.Using BioFaceUsing the machine is pretty straightforward. There are voice commands to guide you through the step-by-step process, rendering the included user manual unnecessary (though you'll still want to keep it handy, as it provides useful recommendations for which fruits and vegetables you can add in, plus their skincare benefits).I've used BioFace to incorporate several ingredients into my face mask (including raspberries and aloe), but my favorite ingredient to use is watermelon for its brightening, hydrating benefits. To start, I mashed up my watermelon chunks into a bowl. (PSA: It would be nice if the machine had a mash or blend function to make this step easier.) You'll really need to liquify your desired fruit or vegetable or mash it up into very fine pieces, as the hole you'll be pouring into is fairly small. After mashing the watermelon chunks until they were liquidy and small enough to fit into the hole, I used the included measuring cup to pour it into the machine along with the recommended amount of water and one collagen tablet. I replaced the cap, pushed the start button, and the waiting game began.\n\n\n\n\nJust pour in your ingredients.\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd out comes a jelly-like face mask.\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\n\n\n\n\nShortly after, the machine began to steam and make mixing sounds. Five minutes later, the machine prompted me to attach the mask tray in preparation for the mixture to come out. Once fully mixed, the mask was ready to go into its mold: I pushed the eject button and out came the red blend, straight into the tray that I had attached. I then used the included spatula to evenly spread the mask into the tray (FYI: You'll have to use a good amount of your active ingredient in order for the end result to fully fill up the tray). Then, I waited a few minutes for the mask to solidify and cool. The instructions say you can use the mask while it's warm, but I prefer putting it in my skincare fridge for a few minutes after it solidifies for more of a cooling skin effect.Some downsidesThe machine doesn't come without a few downsides. For one, the collagen tablets. There's little research supporting the benefits of applying topical collagen onto the skin, and it's unknown what else is in the collagen tablets, which could potentially lead to skin irritation and sensitivities. The mask mold tray also has its quirks \u2014 the cutouts for the eyes and nose are too small, and I found that I had to remove some pieces of the mask in these areas to make it fit my face, which can get a bit messy. Finally, as mentioned, the machine would be more user-friendly if it offered a function to blend your fruits and vegetables \u2014 one less dirty bowl is a win in my book.Is BioFace worth it?Right off the bat, I see several benefits to a machine like this. For one, it's great for those leaning into a simpler skincare routine \u2014 you have full control over the actives that go on your skin (do you want the brightening effects of orange juice or the skin-evening benefits of carrots?). It also helps reduce waste, both in your beauty routine and in your kitchen, whether you're sick of denting your wallet on single-use sheet masks or have a tin of raspberries about to go bad. I also appreciate the self-cleaning feature of the machine, which you can do right after making your mask or later on as its own function.As far as the mask itself, my skin thoroughly enjoys them.

Her page is full of makeup recommendations, beauty tutorials,\xa0and plastic surgery vlogs, but this post stands out, a quick montage of childhood photos showing pre-transition D'Spain. It's tagged #TransAndProud\U0001f3f3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f.\xa0\xa0With more than a million followers on the app, D'Spain has solidified a place in the culture. Her buzz online largely falls within three main areas: her popular social pages, news about her being the first Black transgender model signed to Victoria's Secret, or coverage about her recent gender confirmation surgery.\xa0The 26-year-old is either a ""TikTokker turned model"" or a ""viral beauty influencer"" \u2014 both of which are true \u2014 but she told Mashable those simplified titles are a little bit misleading.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            As U.S. leaders debate a TikTok ban, lawmakers and creators clash over generational and social differences\n            \n\n\n""I went to NYU on a merit-based scholarship, and I was top of my class in marketing and communications,"" she said. D'Spain studied in Paris and wrote her thesis on forms of anonymity in online spaces. ""I was a very studious girlboss. I was working for a marketing agency, so I was booking influencers for campaigns and coming up with campaign concepts for brands. I have such a broad, 360 understanding of this whole industry. I went from marketing to editorial to talent.""Descriptions of D'Spain's rise to popularity often\xa0leave out her career before TikTok, which was already well on its way toward fashion prominence. D'Spain had led editorial content at Paper magazine since her beginnings as a college intern, and curated a following with the magazine's first YouTube beauty series, Snatchural. By 2021, she was the magazine's beauty director and her TikTok page, started as a cross-posting effort amid pandemic lockdown fever, was gaining numbers, as well.\xa0Part of this was due in part to D'Spain's bubbly, bare-it-all openness about her identity as a trans woman, which became the guiding perspective for the publication's beauty coverage.\xa0""I've never once been questioned for who I am,"" she reflected on her personal and professional support system. ""Everyone has let me blossom and let me be me. It's really paid off.""\n\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2021, D'Spain officially announced her name change to the magazine's readers, taking to the site that had cemented her place in the online fashion canon. The Paper article, written by D'Spain in her quintessential ""bestie"" voice to the readers who had followed her beauty career, cited other openly trans celebs like YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous, actor and model Hunter Schafer, and actor Elliot Page as inspiration.\xa0""This past weekend I threw a literal BIRTH day for myself and my new name \u2014 debuting as Emira D'Spain. There are few transgender women who have the platform I do (let alone trans women of color) and this birthday served as an opportunity to introduce myself but also to leverage my platform for the greater health and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community,"" she wrote. ""Of course, I started preparing all my looks months in advance to look perfect for this pivotal moment.""From there, it all took off.\xa0\n    I'm not just like every other beauty bitch. There's so much more to the story.\n    \nD'Spain became the trailblazing pioneer of TikTok's iteration of Get Ready With Me (GRWM) videos \u2014 the app's #GRWM tag now has more than 85 billion videos. Her community of so-called ""C*nty Barbies"" delighted in her daily content about the beauty industry, her routine and product recommendations, and her gradual shift from behind-the-scenes to the talent side of the beauty industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    View this post on Instagram\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(opens in a new tab)\n\n\n\nUshering in magazine covers and a wave of runway work (culminating in her walking at New York Fashion Week this year), D'Spain became a history-making addition to the Victoria's Secret lineup of models in 2022, which, she says, wasn't presented to her as a diversity or representational push from a company facing its own controversy and rebrand.\xa0""It was more so, 'We love your look.' It was not a really crazy PR push from there. We didn't really expect it to pop off and become a whole thing,"" D'Spain remembers. Instead, her followers and the larger beauty community celebrated the deal as an inclusivity win, following a long battle for trans inclusion that gained traction years prior, as the world clamored for model Carmen Carrera to become the first trans woman to sport the angel wings.\xa0\n\n\nThis beauty-first mentality is at the heart of D'Spain's online posting ethic. Mashable asked her where she feels her place is on an app like TikTok, which has become a community-building and organizing space for young, LGBTQ people.\xa0""I think my brand is very fun, big-sister energy. I never had a big sister, so I've always wanted to be that for other people,"" she said. Presenting her expertise and growing popularity in the beauty industry is a form of visibility in and of itself, she says, and her broad commitment to authenticity often means trans identity is also folded into the glittery mix. ""Simply existing on TikTok and sharing my life as a trans woman of color in New York City \u2014 living the life that I do, having the friends and experiences and education that I have, all these things that are so unique to me \u2014 gives people a broader understanding of what a trans person looks like,"" D'Spain explained. ""We're just people. [My identity] is not some weird thing, something that they have these preconceived notions about in their head, especially with older generations.""\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Emira D'Spain\n\n\nUnlike many other LGBTQ creators on TikTok, though, D'Spain explained that she decided to step away from using her page as an educational or organizing tool. ""I chose to build my platform that way because I didn't want to center my identity around being trans. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it didn't feel authentic to my personality and who I am,"" she explained. ""I don't see my account sitting within the queer creator community, because I don't want to take away from the content that they're creating. I feel like for a lot of queer creators that focus their platforms around their identity, they're talking about activism and they're talking about politics \u2014 things that matter, things that are changing our world and that we have to fight for. And while, yes, I try to talk about those things in a light-hearted, funny way, it's not what I came on the app to do.""D'Spain's honest assessment of her page's place in the TikTok ecosystem is a refreshing note within an influencer system that often rewards superficial claims of activism. But she may be selling herself a bit short: Even though LGBTQ politics might not be a specific bullet point in her page's brand description or a common topic in her daily vlogging, she's still making an effort to advance the cause.For instance, D'Spain's announcement of her XOXOEmira change was paired with a fundraiser for the National Center for Transgender Equality. For TikTok's 2022 celebration of Transgender Day of Visibility, D'Spain and Paper joined other creators for the app's #TransVisibility takeover, which recognized TikTok as a ""place to give voice and visibility to historically marginalized communities by amplifying their voices."" They also promoted and donated to the It Gets Better Project and Trans Lifeline.\xa0In February, D'Spain was recognized as a TikTok Visionary Voice, joining other Black creators honored for their significant contributions to the app, and now, on Transgender Day of Visibility, she will be recognized as a leading voice among TikTok's LGBTQ community.\xa0And although her content is not centered on activism, her Get Ready With Me, big-sister approach has resonated with a massive audience, extending a hand of familiarity and acceptance by sharing huge moments in her life. D'Spain debated joining the public conversation about gender affirmation surgeries \u2014 highly politicized, yet life-saving procedures that she ultimately did choose to vlog about, herself. ""My biggest accomplishment is continuing my transition in the public eye,"" she said. Her February TikTok video chronicling her gender affirmation surgery has more than 10 million views.\xa0\n\n\n""I went back and forth for six months, actually, deciding whether or not I was going to talk about it online. I really didn't want to, but I felt that I had to,"" she said. ""And I am glad that I did. I want [my audience] to see that I'm not just a pretty face putting on makeup. I'm not just like every other beauty bitch. There's so much more to the story.""D'Spain's comments pose additional questions: Should her worth as a representational force in a highly exclusive, historically problematic industry depend on how much activism we see on her feeds? How much of her personal story needs to be on display? Is her presence enough?""I don't know if I ever felt like I was that accepted in the beauty space until now, and even then there are still tables in which there are not seats for me,"" she said, quickly transitioning the serious lean of the conversation into her trademarked positive outlook. ""But I think it's fine. It's like\u2026goals and missions to accomplish. Life would be so boring if I was accepted into every single thing that I wanted. What would be the point? What would I fight for?""On her extremely upbeat outlook, truly a feat given the challenging social and political environment she's operating in, D'Spain said, ""I'm a very positive person. Sometimes it's a little much. It gives toxic positivity, even for myself."" She's made an intentional effort to avoid negativity, she explained. ""We're all going to die. We're all going to be eaten by worms one day. So why are we going to be frowning about it?""\n    My biggest piece of advice to every trans person out there is to take your time. There is no rush.\n    \nD'Spain's positivity isn't just up against general and politicized negativity toward her life and identity, she's also choosing to solidify her career in a space that's facing its own foundation-shaking scrutiny. Traditional beauty content and product marketing, as well as their opponents, have found in TikTok an arena for dialogue and deconstruction. Pro- and anti-aging creators stand opposite each other, selling products or convincing women of their worth beyond their appearance. Advocates for and against plastic surgery discuss the normalization of procedures to young audiences and the practice of professionals offering unprompted ""cosmetic advice."" Many others are promoting the notion of complete body neutrality.\xa0As she chronicles her various, gender-affirming cosmetic treatments or posts ad spots with beauty brands, what does D'Spain think about it all?""In terms of preservation,"" she explained, noting that she despises both the phrases ""anti-aging"" and ""pro-aging,"" ""what you want to preserve with your face, or what you want to take care of with your body, it's such an individual choice. I don't think anyone should be judging another person for it."" Gender affirmation also factors into her perspective on the beauty world.""I think a lot of trans people really heavily focus their identity, and their trans identity, around their external beauty, around 'passing' or looking like the gender they identify with,"" she explained, noting her experience is just that: her own. ""I feel like you have to do the internal work first. My biggest piece of advice to every trans person out there is to take your time. There is no rush. You don't have to have all the plastic surgery work done, the hair, lashes, makeup \u2014 embrace who you are. Embrace your body. Know that your gender identity is your gender identity. You are already that person. And you will get there over time.""For decades, trans bodies have been interrogated, socially policed, and made the epicenter of legislative debates about human rights. In many communities, queer or straight, the problematic notion of ""passing,"" or not being perceived as transgender, (something D'Spain gets comments about a lot) has rendered many complex conversations about gender presentation and social acceptance into superficial conversations on beauty. But with perspectives like that shared by D'Spain and other strikingly open folks like her, many hope the public perception of trans and gender nonconforming identities will evolve beyond this limited scope and closer to the reality of affirmation and transformation. ""The trans experience is just so special. Over time, your relationship with beauty becomes less toxic. It becomes less about concealing, about hiding, and more about coming into yourself.""",Emira D'Spain's rose-colored glasses are both a fashion accessory and a way of life,"""If there's a glowup challenge, I'm gonna slay,"" writes Emira D'Spain in the caption of one of her glimmeringly saturated TikTok posts. Her page is full of makeup recommendations, beauty tutorials,\xa0and plastic surgery vlogs, but this post stands out, a quick montage of childhood photos showing pre-transition D'Spain. It's tagged #TransAndProud\U0001f3f3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f.\xa0\xa0With more than a million followers on the app, D'Spain has solidified a place in the culture. Her buzz online largely falls within three main areas: her popular social pages, news about her being the first Black transgender model signed to Victoria's Secret, or coverage about her recent gender confirmation surgery.\xa0The 26-year-old is either a ""TikTokker turned model"" or a ""viral beauty influencer"" \u2014 both of which are true \u2014 but she told Mashable those simplified titles are a little bit misleading.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            As U.S. leaders debate a TikTok ban, lawmakers and creators clash over generational and social differences\n            \n\n\n""I went to NYU on a merit-based scholarship, and I was top of my class in marketing and communications,"" she said. D'Spain studied in Paris and wrote her thesis on forms of anonymity in online spaces. ""I was a very studious girlboss. I was working for a marketing agency, so I was booking influencers for campaigns and coming up with campaign concepts for brands. I have such a broad, 360 understanding of this whole industry. I went from marketing to editorial to talent.""Descriptions of D'Spain's rise to popularity often\xa0leave out her career before TikTok, which was already well on its way toward fashion prominence. D'Spain had led editorial content at Paper magazine since her beginnings as a college intern, and curated a following with the magazine's first YouTube beauty series, Snatchural. By 2021, she was the magazine's beauty director and her TikTok page, started as a cross-posting effort amid pandemic lockdown fever, was gaining numbers, as well.\xa0Part of this was due in part to D'Spain's bubbly, bare-it-all openness about her identity as a trans woman, which became the guiding perspective for the publication's beauty coverage.\xa0""I've never once been questioned for who I am,"" she reflected on her personal and professional support system. ""Everyone has let me blossom and let me be me. It's really paid off.""\n\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2021, D'Spain officially announced her name change to the magazine's readers, taking to the site that had cemented her place in the online fashion canon.

52b678bd-d55f-4a7c-90cd-fa823e8332d4,"'Rye Lane' review: Lovable losers rom-com is a total winner - Out of Sundance 2023, Rye Lane shined bright, becoming one of our faves out of the prestigious fest. In her feature directorial debut, Raine Allen-Miller brings scads of style and astounding energy to a joyous and juicy tale of lovable losers who find romantic redemption in South London. Not only does it boast charming lead performances by David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah, but this cheeky romantic comedy also contains what Mashable UK Editor Shannon Connellan called ""the greatest scene of re-meeting an ex in cinema history."" Now coming to Hulu, Rye Lane demands to be added to your watch list.\xa0Rye Lane pays tribute to romantic comedies, while gleefully subverting them.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n\nLike many a rom-com that's come before, Rye Lane is set in a bustling city, where two total opposites fall in love thanks to happenstance and eventual open-heartedness. However, the screenplay from Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia plays with breezy tropes by turning a meet-cute into a meet-cringe. Rather than an adorable ""how we met"" anecdote that'll thrill dinner party guests, Yas (Vivian Oparah) and Dom (David Jonsson) meet in the toilets, where he is sobbing loudly over a devastating breakup. From there, it's not so much sparks that fly as an uncomfortable series of embarrassments, like trying to part ways on the street \u2014\xa0only to discover you're headed in the same direction. The horror!\xa0Thankfully, Yas is a garrulous extrovert who refuses to recognize an awkward pause, barreling right through to probe for trauma dumps. Though meek and shy, Dom can't resist the warmth of the spotlight she shines on him, and so the two stumble into an accidental date that'll trek around South London, specifically the eponymous neighborhood of Rye Lane.\xa0 Along the way, there will be rom-com requisites like bouncy banter, painfully hip romantic rivals, grand gestures, and outrageous shenanigans. There's even a clever cameo, alluding to perhaps the most iconic London-set rom-com, Love Actually. But amid all this, Rye Lane pushes for something more surreal and strange, making it thrillingly unique.\xa0When recounting bad breakups or early childhood ambitions, Allen-Miller doesn't just shoot a bog-standard walk-and-talk or a cozy coffee shop conversation. Instead, Rye Lane crash-lands audiences into fourth wall-breaking flashbacks wherein modern-day Dom and Yas burst in like the Ghosts of Christmas Past to snoop about and ask probing questions. So, Yas's story about hummus and giving head is staged like a theatrical production, with an audience full of Doms cheers her on. This device thrusts us not only into the perspectives of our lovestruck duo by welcoming us into memories and revenge fantasies but also electrifyingly illustrates their connection. They could be heroes for each other \u2014 if they could just get out of their own heads!Rye Lane comes alive with color.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n\nThe immersiveness of this enthralling rom-com doesn't stop with these mind plunges. Allen-Miller captures Rye Lane and its assortment of shops, street art, and eccentric characters with such passion and detail that you can almost smell the burritos baking or reach out and touch the fresh produce glistening in the brightly painted stalls. As Dom and Yas stroll by shops, bus stops, or playgrounds, every sequence is popping with color and motion.\xa0Cinematography sweeps around these could-be lovers with an energy that nods to Allen-Miller's background helming colorful commercials. Low angles play up the juicy intensity when exes collide. But most effective is how cinematographer Olan Collardy employs a first-person perspective for pivotal interactions. Like the riotous hit sitcom Peep Show, POV shots pitch us into the pastel-colored sneakers of Dom and Yas, allowing us the take part in the delicious anxiety of first flirtations.\xa0As to color: Teal, sunflower yellow, flamingo pink, and bright red explode from costumes, murals, and awnings. In the background, a pair of dancing children's clothes reflect the wall art behind them, as if they'd sprung to life from the art itself. Elsewhere, a shirtless, pot-bellied man protrudes from a window, overlooking his garden, lost in thought. A wannabe cowboy glistens in glitter from head to toe, quipping and tipping his wide-brimmed hat. Across it all, music bobs and weaves, bringing energy and joyous, uninhibited sing-alongs that tempt you to join in for the chorus at least.\xa0The liveliness of the settings suggests that Rye Lane is not just a magical spot for Dom and Yas, but that we could follow anybody passing through and be welcomed into another warm and wonderful tale. That's how alive this movie's world feels.\xa0Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson are beyond charming in Rye Lane.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n\nAll these sensory splendors could be for nothing if it weren't for the two leads whose hearts pump at the core of this radiant rom-com. Thankfully, Oparah and Jonsson are dynamite together, whether bickering or breaking into a karaoke duet for the ages. Out the gate, Jonsson is faced with a hurdle: how to be a crushworthy rom-com hero when you begin weeping in a public restroom? Jonsson gamely plays the fool for love, but he shrewdly keeps Dom's mopiness comical rather than morose. Within his trembling grin and cocked eyebrow, resilience flickers. The more he's exposed to Yas's boldness, the more Dom revives. Jonsson reflects this growth in a physicality that steadily shifts from cowering to confident. Dom may begin as a doormat \u2014\xa0tromped on by love gone wrong \u2014 but by the mid-way, he's stood up to be Yas's partner in crime for a hilariously ill-concieved breaking-and-entering.\xa0For her part, Oparah begins as bombastic, a human firework popping with brash pronouncements, jolting jokes, and bold moves that sometimes involve petty acts of vandalism involving a menstrual cup. However, as the date goes on, the cracks in Yas's confident veneer begin to show. While Dom's vulnerabilities make him soft, Yas's hold sharp edges that lead to chaotic comedy with an undercurrent of self-doubt.\xa0Overall, Rye Lane is a rhythmically bouncy romantic romp that keeps things fun even when running into the rougher corners of romance. A kickin' soundtrack, vivid color palette, and lively setting blooming with detail add oomph to the film's fun and enthralling attitude. Yet Oparah and Jonsson keep things from feeling one-note or too fluffy by lacing in the relatable cringe of heartache, jealousy, self-doubt, and fear of rejection. So when the stakes hit, they hit good and bracing, allowing us the space to yearn ahead of a finale that's made for big, fat smiles.\xa0Simply put. Rye Lane is a winsome delight, alive with color, verve, humor, and heart. If you love rom-coms, it's essential viewing. And if you don't, well, this gem might just change your mind.\xa0Rye Lane is now streaming exclusively on Hulu.

So, Yas's story about hummus and giving head is staged like a theatrical production, with an audience full of Doms cheers her on. This device thrusts us not only into the perspectives of our lovestruck duo by welcoming us into memories and revenge fantasies but also electrifyingly illustrates their connection. They could be heroes for each other \u2014 if they could just get out of their own heads!Rye Lane comes alive with color.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n\nThe immersiveness of this enthralling rom-com doesn't stop with these mind plunges. Allen-Miller captures Rye Lane and its assortment of shops, street art, and eccentric characters with such passion and detail that you can almost smell the burritos baking or reach out and touch the fresh produce glistening in the brightly painted stalls. As Dom and Yas stroll by shops, bus stops, or playgrounds, every sequence is popping with color and motion.\xa0Cinematography sweeps around these could-be lovers with an energy that nods to Allen-Miller's background helming colorful commercials. Low angles play up the juicy intensity when exes collide. But most effective is how cinematographer Olan Collardy employs a first-person perspective for pivotal interactions. Like the riotous hit sitcom Peep Show, POV shots pitch us into the pastel-colored sneakers of Dom and Yas, allowing us the take part in the delicious anxiety of first flirtations.\xa0As to color: Teal, sunflower yellow, flamingo pink, and bright red explode from costumes, murals, and awnings. In the background, a pair of dancing children's clothes reflect the wall art behind them, as if they'd sprung to life from the art itself. Elsewhere, a shirtless, pot-bellied man protrudes from a window, overlooking his garden, lost in thought. A wannabe cowboy glistens in glitter from head to toe, quipping and tipping his wide-brimmed hat. Across it all, music bobs and weaves, bringing energy and joyous, uninhibited sing-alongs that tempt you to join in for the chorus at least.\xa0The liveliness of the settings suggests that Rye Lane is not just a magical spot for Dom and Yas, but that we could follow anybody passing through and be welcomed into another warm and wonderful tale. That's how alive this movie's world feels.\xa0Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson are beyond charming in Rye Lane.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n\nAll these sensory splendors could be for nothing if it weren't for the two leads whose hearts pump at the core of this radiant rom-com. Thankfully, Oparah and Jonsson are dynamite together, whether bickering or breaking into a karaoke duet for the ages. Out the gate, Jonsson is faced with a hurdle: how to be a crushworthy rom-com hero when you begin weeping in a public restroom? Jonsson gamely plays the fool for love, but he shrewdly keeps Dom's mopiness comical rather than morose. Within his trembling grin and cocked eyebrow, resilience flickers. The more he's exposed to Yas's boldness, the more Dom revives. Jonsson reflects this growth in a physicality that steadily shifts from cowering to confident. Dom may begin as a doormat \u2014\xa0tromped on by love gone wrong \u2014 but by the mid-way, he's stood up to be Yas's partner in crime for a hilariously ill-concieved breaking-and-entering.\xa0For her part, Oparah begins as bombastic, a human firework popping with brash pronouncements, jolting jokes, and bold moves that sometimes involve petty acts of vandalism involving a menstrual cup. However, as the date goes on, the cracks in Yas's confident veneer begin to show. While Dom's vulnerabilities make him soft, Yas's hold sharp edges that lead to chaotic comedy with an undercurrent of self-doubt.\xa0Overall, Rye Lane is a rhythmically bouncy romantic romp that keeps things fun even when running into the rougher corners of romance. A kickin' soundtrack, vivid color palette, and lively setting blooming with detail add oomph to the film's fun and enthralling attitude. Yet Oparah and Jonsson keep things from feeling one-note or too fluffy by lacing in the relatable cringe of heartache, jealousy, self-doubt, and fear of rejection. So when the stakes hit, they hit good and bracing, allowing us the space to yearn ahead of a finale that's made for big, fat smiles.\xa0Simply put. Rye Lane is a winsome delight, alive with color, verve, humor, and heart. If you love rom-coms, it's essential viewing. And if you don't, well, this gem might just change your mind.\xa0Rye Lane is now streaming exclusively on Hulu.

c06c1803-7612-457c-917a-38dbddac18f2,"'Tetris' review: This movie is far better than it has any right to be - A Tetris movie sounds like a punchline about how Hollywood has truly run out of ideas. After a sea of sequels, remakes, and movie adaptations based on every kind of toy on the market, a film based on a video game in which you arrange blocks seems like it should be a bridge too far. It should be stupid. And frankly, this Tetris gets a tad stupid, albeit in a brilliant way. Combining the stranger-than-fiction story of its making with an ardent embrace of the game's aesthetic and nostalgia for the era more broadly, Tetris is a surprisingly smart, silly, and satisfying adventure.\xa0I entered a cynic and came out grinning like a fool.\xa0Tetris is the true story of Henk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Apple TV+\n\n\nScripted by Noah Pink, Tetris introduces us to Dutch video game designer Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) in 1988, as he's witnessing a demo of Tetris at a convention in Las Vegas; it dawns on him that he's watching nothing less than the future of gaming. As the founder of Bullet-Proof Software, Henk is eager to make a deal for Tetris's international rights, and he tries to broker with a British firm as well as Nintendo. But all his hard work \u2014\xa0and life's savings \u2014 are put at risk when it turns out the Russian government owns the game and has no intention of playing fair.\xa0Caught in the Cold War crosshairs of this battle of business, politics, and shady dealings is Tetris inventor Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov), a Soviet computer engineer with a love of games. What began as a hobby became a viral sensation \u2014\xa0in the era of floppy disks, no less! With the possibility that Tetris could bring major money into the Soviet Union, it's not Pajitnov who makes the call on who'll distribute his puzzle game. It's up to a government that is falling apart at the seams and increasingly corrupt.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Tetris' appreciates the magic of making video games\n            \n\n\nAmid political intrigue, none-too-subtle threats from the KGB, and harassment from bullish British billionaires, Henk and Alexey form an unlikely friendship that will be tested as Tetris's future is determined.\xa0Taron Egerton is precisely the star Tetris demands.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Apple TV+\n\n\nAs much of the movie consists of Henk bouncing from one business meeting to another contract negotiation, Tetris director Jon S. Baird faced a major obstacle in keeping this seemingly banal string of events entertaining. In combatting the threatening tedium of business, business, business, his secret weapon is the Welsh actor who's brought unflinching verve to the working-class superspy of Kingsman, the plucky underdog of Eddie the Eagle, and the blinding charisma of Elton John in Rocketman.Right out the gate, Tetris welcomes us in with the guileless smile and can-do attitude that exudes from under Egerton's bushy, deeply '80s mustache. Playing a man born in Denmark but raised in New York, he affects an American accent with a romping enthusiasm that gently reflects the capitalist expectation that everything is for sale and the never-say-die optimism that's fueled American business of this era. This is where the open enthusiasm of Egerton's persona is key. While there's an air of The Founder's opportunistic businessman about him, Henk's passion for Tetris isn't only tied to his conviction it'll be a hit but also his genuine love of the game itself.\xa0Greed isn't good to Henk; games are good. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            The best movies out of SXSW 2023 and where to watch them\n            \n\n\nHis enthusiasm is contagious, ushering the audience back into the experience of discovering the iconic puzzle game and its mesmerizing, addictive wonders for the first time. This effusiveness binds us to Henk as he bounds around the globe, from his family's crowded Tokyo apartment to Nintendo's secret R&D offices in Seattle, to self-important multimedia offices in London, and even to the off-limits government buildings in Moscow. As the tension ratchets up, turning the stakes to life or death, Egerton's charm goes from a lure to a floatation device, assuring us he'll see us through with the confident glimmer in his eye.\xa0Tetris comes alive with elements from the game.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Apple TV+\n\n\nThe other major tool to keeping Tetris moving and fun \u2014 even as it stumbles into the muck of business and corruption \u2014\xa0is how Baird works in elements from the game. From the start, 8-bit animation is used to spice up the film's aesthetic. Chapter titles introduce ""players,"" complete with 8-bit avatars of Henk, Alexey, and their friends and foes. Standard establishing shots of locations, like a convention center or Hank's home, are substituted with 8-bit illustrations as a new ""chapter"" title card is introduced.\xa0Elsewhere, the subtitles use a font that harkens back to the sharp lines of '80s video games, while the music blaring in an underground club embraces the outrageousness of Western culture of the time and its sheer gusto. When Henk rocks out to Europe's ""The Final Countdown,"" I dare you not to bop along. Elsewhere in the soundscape, sound effects pulled from old-school games replace real-life sounds, like pinging footsteps, which bring an added zing to simple actions. The animation of falling blocks appears as a dreamy overlay as Henk waxes poetic about the magic of the Tetris game. All of this plays in sharp contrast to the starkly gray, cold, and concrete world of Moscow, where things are bleak and utterly lacking the dazzle of Tetris's colorful graphics and zinging score.\xa0This weird juxtaposition reaches its zenith during a climactic car chase scene that's scored by the Tetris game music. It's ludicrous! It's stupid! It's glorious! It playfully winks that the movie is taking some serious liberties from the real story! The car itself jumps out of its metal reality and transforms into an 8-bit automobile. Rather than undercutting the stakes of this escape attempt, Baird's playful flourishes give the audience a visual reminder of what Henk and Alexey are racing toward. It's not just a game but the dream of sharing their creative vision with the world, breaking down barriers of what is and what could be, and the crushing tedium of our day-to-day, eight bits at a time! Style and star power can't smooth out all of Tetris's rough edges, though. Despite Baird's best efforts, the second act gets a bit bogged down in scenes away from our two heroes. These sequences draw the distinction between the movie's heroic dreamers and their greedy, cold-hearted business antagonists. These villains are a drag because they are such staunch stereotypes of greed, entitlement, and cynicism. While these figures are another very '80s element, snarling at the decade's vices, a little goes a long way with such characters. Yet Baird has an even longer way to go with them, which means repeating the same punchlines and posturing again and again. Still, Tetris is way better a movie than I dared hope. I loved the game growing up, as was expected of the Game Boy Generation. Admittedly, the trailer teased a self-aware sense of wit, playing this Cold War thriller like a zany comedy. Still, I had my doubts going in, because on its face a movie based on Tetris seems absurd. Despite my reservations, I can't deny this biopic is downright delightful. At times, Baird struggles with balancing the tone of Henk's whimsical enthusiasm with the furrow-browed intensity of the Soviet spy schtick. Overall, Tetris is a thrilling romp full of humor, heart, and a kinetic message of hope.

d55bee12-6f5c-4ff0-8f9b-f7f6fc8a7de2,"The best VPN deals of the week include 75% off a 27-month NordVPN plan (no code required) - \nUPDATE: Mar. 31, 2023, 5:00 a.m. EDT This story has been updated.\n\nUsing a virtual private network (or VPN) is an easy way to bypass geo-restrictions on streaming content, avoid certain cyber threats while gaming, protect company data while working remotely, and browse anonymously on public WiFi networks. Most providers' plans cost anywhere from $2 to $12 per month, though many lure customers in with discounted introductory rates that skyrocket after your initial term. To help you lock in a plan that'll fit your budget in the short and long run, we're compiling a weekly roundup of the best deals on all the VPNs we've personally tested.

It's nothing particularly special (and its U.S. headquarters location isn't ideal), but for users in search of a basic VPN with open-source apps, built-in ad blocking, and unlimited simultaneous connections, PIA is worth a look. You'll pay just $2.11/month (billed $56.94 upfront) for 27 months of coverage during its annual Spring Sale, shaving 82% off its regular rate of $11.99/month; that does include a 30-day money-back guarantee.

7d59c78a-77bc-4f53-afcf-45a1c0653494,"'Yellowjackets' watch: Who is Misty's new friend, PuttingtheSICKinForensics? - In Season 1 of Yellowjackets, Misty Quigley was the only citizen detective we needed to keep an eye on. True crime-obsessed, Misty proved a friend indeed when her friend in need, Shauna, needed help disposing of the body of her slain lover Adam. Season 2 begins with Misty grilling Shauna in a mock interrogation, just to cover their bases. But could Misty have met her match with a mysterious man online?\xa0On the citizen detective message boards that Misty frequents as ""AfricanGrey,"" a potential rival has arisen. A user with the handle ""PuttingtheSICKinForensics"" has been focusing his amateur sleuthing on the missing person's case of Adam Martin, which could be disastrous for Team Yellowjackets. So, who is this guy?\xa0Let's chase down the clues each week to uncover this Yellowjackets mystery.\xa0Who is PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Scott Kirkland/SHOWTIME\n\n\nFrom the trailers for Season 2, we know Christina Ricci, who plays present-day Misty, shares scenes with fellow '90s icon Elijah Wood. Plus, the Lord of the Rings star's sprightly voice is easily identifiable in episode one, ""Friends, Romans, Countrymen,"" as the voiceover source of fellow online citizen detective PuttingtheSICKinForensics; Wood is also listed as Walter in the show's credits. In this first ep, Misty is infuriated to find Adam Martin's (Peter Gadiot) disappearance has become the focus of\xa0PuttingtheSICKinForensics. More worrisome, her fellow sleuthing fan is on the right track, posting a theory that Adam's disappearance might be blamed on an unknown girlfriend. To save Shauna from suspicion, Misty uses her reputation as a well-reputed citizen detective to malign this theory. But could there be clues within Walter's initial post?\xa0Amid the tedious telegraph schtick, Walter notes that he's gotten ahold of Adam's bank statements, and from the charges has determined the missing man had a new love interest. Of course, he's onto something. But how did Walter get ahold of Adam's bank statements? Maybe he's a savvy hacker. Maybe, like Natalie's former sponsor, he works at a bank. Maybe he's pulled a Misty, getting his hands dirty by going through Adam's trash. By the end of episode 1, we have no way of knowing for sure.\xa0What does Episode 2 tell us about PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nIn Season 2 episode 2 (""Edible Complex""), Walter makes his first appearance on Yellowjackets while making an intriguing impression on Misty.\xa0It begins with Misty reaching out on the f/BureauofCitizenDetectives message board for help hacking the motel security camera, so she might uncover what happened to Nat. Walter pipes up, offering, ""I might have an idea, but only if you stop shitting all over my Adam Martin theories."" Misty snarls and quickly accuses him of going on ""wild goose chases."" But Walter's not giving up.\xa0Soon, Wood's familiar voice is drifting through the old folks' home where Misty works. Amid probing questions about air quality and staff background checks, Walter makes knowing eye contact with Misty. She then finds a note addressed to her in the staff fridge. It appears to be blank, but a flash of a UV light reveals that SICK has found her and is eager to help her in her quest to find Nat. He's even set up an interview with a potential witness, masquerading as an FBI agent. Asking if ""Agent Quigley"" would care to join is just about the most romantic thing Misty might hope for. But this guy is trying to expose her friend for murder. So, their love story has a rocky road ahead.\xa0Shipping potential aside, who is Walter beyond a rival/love interest for Misty? Could there be a clue in Season 1?\xa0Is Walter a friend of Adam's?\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Michael Courtney/SHOWTIME\n\n\nConsider this: Misty's current focus on the message boards is cracking the case of MIA Nat, a friend for which she'd do anything (including hard drugs). If Walter is Misty's match, as he seems to be, could he be similarly motivated in Adam's case?When Adam died, Shauna knew frustratingly little about him. In Season 1 episode 8, ""Flight of the Bumblebee,"" Shauna confronts Adam over his lies about going to art school at Pratt. From there, Adam proposes a romantic get-to-know-him getaway. ""Look, I've got this friend with a cabin in the woods in the Poconos,"" Adam said, ""Let's go away for the weekend. I'll be an open book.""\xa0He doesn't say, ""Let's get a hotel"" or ""Let's take a trip."" Adam specifically mentions a friend with a cabin.

True crime-obsessed, Misty proved a friend indeed when her friend in need, Shauna, needed help disposing of the body of her slain lover Adam. Season 2 begins with Misty grilling Shauna in a mock interrogation, just to cover their bases. But could Misty have met her match with a mysterious man online?\xa0On the citizen detective message boards that Misty frequents as ""AfricanGrey,"" a potential rival has arisen. A user with the handle ""PuttingtheSICKinForensics"" has been focusing his amateur sleuthing on the missing person's case of Adam Martin, which could be disastrous for Team Yellowjackets. So, who is this guy?\xa0Let's chase down the clues each week to uncover this Yellowjackets mystery.\xa0Who is PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Scott Kirkland/SHOWTIME\n\n\nFrom the trailers for Season 2, we know Christina Ricci, who plays present-day Misty, shares scenes with fellow '90s icon Elijah Wood. Plus, the Lord of the Rings star's sprightly voice is easily identifiable in episode one, ""Friends, Romans, Countrymen,"" as the voiceover source of fellow online citizen detective PuttingtheSICKinForensics; Wood is also listed as Walter in the show's credits. In this first ep, Misty is infuriated to find Adam Martin's (Peter Gadiot) disappearance has become the focus of\xa0PuttingtheSICKinForensics. More worrisome, her fellow sleuthing fan is on the right track, posting a theory that Adam's disappearance might be blamed on an unknown girlfriend. To save Shauna from suspicion, Misty uses her reputation as a well-reputed citizen detective to malign this theory. But could there be clues within Walter's initial post?\xa0Amid the tedious telegraph schtick, Walter notes that he's gotten ahold of Adam's bank statements, and from the charges has determined the missing man had a new love interest. Of course, he's onto something. But how did Walter get ahold of Adam's bank statements? Maybe he's a savvy hacker. Maybe, like Natalie's former sponsor, he works at a bank. Maybe he's pulled a Misty, getting his hands dirty by going through Adam's trash. By the end of episode 1, we have no way of knowing for sure.\xa0What does Episode 2 tell us about PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nIn Season 2 episode 2 (""Edible Complex""), Walter makes his first appearance on Yellowjackets while making an intriguing impression on Misty.\xa0It begins with Misty reaching out on the f/BureauofCitizenDetectives message board for help hacking the motel security camera, so she might uncover what happened to Nat. Walter pipes up, offering, ""I might have an idea, but only if you stop shitting all over my Adam Martin theories."" Misty snarls and quickly accuses him of going on ""wild goose chases."" But Walter's not giving up.\xa0Soon, Wood's familiar voice is drifting through the old folks' home where Misty works. Amid probing questions about air quality and staff background checks, Walter makes knowing eye contact with Misty. She then finds a note addressed to her in the staff fridge. It appears to be blank, but a flash of a UV light reveals that SICK has found her and is eager to help her in her quest to find Nat. He's even set up an interview with a potential witness, masquerading as an FBI agent. Asking if ""Agent Quigley"" would care to join is just about the most romantic thing Misty might hope for. But this guy is trying to expose her friend for murder. So, their love story has a rocky road ahead.\xa0Shipping potential aside, who is Walter beyond a rival/love interest for Misty? Could there be a clue in Season 1?\xa0Is Walter a friend of Adam's?\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Michael Courtney/SHOWTIME\n\n\nConsider this: Misty's current focus on the message boards is cracking the case of MIA Nat, a friend for which she'd do anything (including hard drugs). If Walter is Misty's match, as he seems to be, could he be similarly motivated in Adam's case?When Adam died, Shauna knew frustratingly little about him. In Season 1 episode 8, ""Flight of the Bumblebee,"" Shauna confronts Adam over his lies about going to art school at Pratt. From there, Adam proposes a romantic get-to-know-him getaway. ""Look, I've got this friend with a cabin in the woods in the Poconos,"" Adam said, ""Let's go away for the weekend. I'll be an open book.""\xa0He doesn't say, ""Let's get a hotel"" or ""Let's take a trip."" Adam specifically mentions a friend with a cabin. Presumably, he's already asked that friend if he could borrow the place for the weekend. And maybe he even floated why: time alone with a new girlfriend.\xa0Could Walter be the friend with a cabin?

b20abc6c-1336-474f-a8fd-8450b02732ca,"'Yellowjackets' Season 2: What's the deal with Lottie's cult? - For the entirety of Yellowjackets Season 1, we had no idea whether Lottie (Courtney Eaton) was alive in the present day. But in the season finale, we finally got confirmation she'd made it through the wilderness.What's Lottie been doing for 25 years since they were finally rescued from the wilderness? Amid Natalie (Juliette Lewis) and Misty's (Christina Ricci) investigations into the suspicious death of Travis (Andres Soto), we find out Lottie (Simone Kessell) was the one responsible for draining his bank account after he died. How is Lottie connected to Travis's death? What's her plan with all of his cash?\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Yellowjackets' burning questions we have going into Season 2\n            \n\n\nWell, in Season 2, we finally catch up with Lottie, who appears to be running a cult \u2014 sorry, a wellness retreat \u2014 called Camp Green Pine. What exactly is this place? Who are these purple-clad people? Here's everything we know so far, and we'll be updating this each week with additional details revealed per episode.What happened to Lottie after the Yellowjackets were rescued?\n\n\n\n\nWhere's Lottie been?\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nLottie's return to society was not a smooth one. We get a glimpse into the team's 1998 return in the second season's first episode, as we see the girls herded past one hungry press horde. Since their return, Lottie hasn't uttered a word. She spends her nights silently wandering around her parents' home, so they have her committed to a psychiatric facility. During a session of electroconvulsive therapy, Lottie experiences flashbacks to her visions from the wilderness, and later in her hospital room she uses her ""healing hand"" breathing technique to calm her roommate's anxiety attack, like she did multiple times with Travis in the woods. It seems Lottie may have been inspired by her own confidence in her healing abilities to open a dedicated facility...in the woods.What's the nature of Lottie's wellness retreat?\n\n\n\n\nLottie's gone back into the woods, sort of.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nWhen we first meet Lottie as an adult, she's giving a motivational talk from a minimalist wooden stage in a stunning lakeside location, near a woods. She's orating to an audience completely dressed in shades of purple \u2014 ""It\u2019s heliotrope, it\u2019s not purple,"" Lottie insists. ""We make the dye ourselves from the flowers used to treat wounds."" \u2014 while she's dressed in bright orange. I'm just saying, it's the same hue as the followers of Rajneeshpuram, the commune established in rural Oregon in the 1980s that formed the focus of Netflix's Wild Wild Country. Do with that what you will.""There's only one person who can really give you what you're looking for: You. Your truest, most authentic self. That's why you're here, so I can introduce you,"" Lottie tells her audience. ""Right now there is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self. And there is nothing more painful than hiding that self.""\n\n\n\n\n""There is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self.""\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nBut so far, there's no cult-like activity at Camp Green Pine. Lottie appears to be running a pretty standard holistic mental health retreat for people seeking therapy for trauma or to process negative emotions. In episode 2, when questioned by Natalie, Lottie calmly explains, ""We are not a cult. We are an intentional community turning suffering into strength so we can live as our best selves.""Chickens roam freely among the camp's curated grounds, residents sit in quiet conversation around the communal bonfire when they're not in their fancy cabins, and late at night, they engage in ritualistic faux burials wearing animal masks and white robes \u2014 or sometimes nothing at all. ""A therapeutic treatment, one of many we offer here,"" Lottie explains in episode 2. Who knows if there's a quiz night? But it's not all Goopy woo-woo wellness vibes all the time, as Lottie momentarily loses her chill over something so small as a health shake ingredient. When her associate Lisa (Nicole Maines) brings her daily shake, she quietly reprimands her. ""I smell butterscotch, did you put maca root in here? Hmm. I asked for ashwagandha. I want my focus increased, not my libido."" Feigning she's fine with it as Natalie is present, Lottie then promptly throws her shake, in a reusable cup with reusable straw, in the garbage.But there's one thing at Camp Green Pine it appears Lottie brought back from the woods: that dreaded symbol.\n\n\n\n\nLottie seems to have borrowed a little somethin' from the wilderness.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nThe seemingly apotropaic icon we've seen all series immediately comes into play in episode 1, when Natalie notices it being worn as a pendant by Lisa: ""That thing around your neck tells me all I need to know.""Why did Lottie's group kidnap Natalie?\n\n\n\n\nNot a gentle introduction.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nEssentially, Lottie's community members kidnapped Natalie to save her life. But they didn't save her...gently. In the first season's finale, a group of purple-clad people burst into Natalie's hotel room just as she's about to kill herself, dragging her into a van marked with the symbol from the wilderness. In Season 2's first episode, Natalie is being held captive in a wooden cabin, where she's restrained by the wrists. Why does Lottie have bed cuffs installed in her accommodation? ""We were afraid you were going to hurt yourself,"" says Lisa, who has been assigned to supervise Natalie. It appears to be the type of physical restraint used in psychiatric facilities, and as Natalie realises, it's not a regular practice residents like Lisa are used to at all.

Not exactly welcoming, huh?How did Lottie's cult begin in the wilderness?\n\n\n\n\n""I have a bad feeling about this place.""\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nLottie's journey toward becoming the Yellowjackets' spiritual leader in the wilderness runs a steady pace in Season 1, but hasn't quite been defined yet in Season 2. Though Lottie's initial connection to spirituality seems loose in Season 1, her increasingly prominent ""visions"" define her experience in the wilderness, from her French-speaking outburst during the attic seance to Jackie finding her standing in the lake in her PJs, not to mention her underwater premonition of Laura Lee's explosive death. Lottie is the first Yellowjacket to find one of the series' signature spooky symbols carved into a tree, and she dons a crown of antlers in the ""Doomcoming"" episode, all but confirming she's the Antler Queen from the Season 1's opening scene of ritualistic cannibalism.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nTripping on Misty's mushrooms, Lottie easily leads several fellow Yellowjackets into a bacchanal of screaming, howling girls who pursue Travis for their own hedonistic, violent, and possibly sacrificial means. During their psychedelic journey, Lottie says aloud, ""We won't be hungry much longer."" The next day, she confronts a bear that wanders near their cabin and seemingly kneels before her so she can kill it. This moment seems to solidify her divine association to several followers, including Van and Misty, who join her for a ritualistic offering of the bear's heart to an altar. ""Shed blood, my beautiful friends, and let the darkness set us free,"" Lottie declares. \n\n\n\n\nNeva4get.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nDuring their time in the woods, Lottie constantly talks about this darkness in the wilderness ""being in all of you."" During the seance scene, she repeats the words, ""It wants\u2026It wants\u2026It wants\u2026hungry,"" before speaking in French about something wanting blood and declaring, ""You must spill blood or else.""By Season 2's first episode, Lottie's not exactly running nightly bloodbath ceremonies, but she has established a ritual of giving Travis and Natalie tea she's pricked her finger and bled into before each hunt, then drawing the symbol on the window to keep them safe.Lottie's gift of foresight has a longer history.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nLottie's experiences with visions run deeper than her time in the wilderness. In Season 1, the series takes us back into Lottie's childhood, when she screams in terror from the back seat of her parents' car right before a crash occurs \u2014 one that would have most certainly involved their car had she not screamed, causing her dad to brake. Dismissing the possibility of Lottie's clairvoyance, her parents decide to send her to a psychiatrist, where she's prescribed an ambiguous medication for her mental health. In the wilderness, Lottie takes her last remaining pill, and the visions begin.Why did Lottie take Travis's money?\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Eaton as Lottie and Kevin Alves as Travis.\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nIt's confirmed in the season finale that Lottie was the one to drain Travis's bank account after he died, but did she use the money to fund her retreat? Considering Lottie's establishment is well up and running, it seems unlikely she used the money for this purpose. What was Travis and Lottie's relationship like after they left the wilderness though? Beyond that whole almost-sacrificial moment (whoops!), Travis seems to have found a spiritual connection with Lottie during her anxiety-quelling breathing practices, and Lottie flashes into Travis' mind during sex with Natalie. Plus, Lottie has been insistent that Javi, his missing brother, is alive in the woods, despite Nat's criticism of this ""false hope."" \n\n\n\n\nLottie says Travis gave her instructions to access his bank accounts.\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\n\n\nWhen grown-up Natalie confronts Lottie in episode 1, she's pretty damn pissed, though Lottie claims to have a message for her from Travis. In episode 2, this turns out to be the note Travis wrote and left in his house, reading ""Tell Nat she was right."" Lottie tells Nat the story of Travis' death as accidental in his quest to somehow communicate with the darkness from the wilderness. Driving to his house after a worrying call, Lottie finds Travis panicking, saying, ""When Van almost died, when you did, you both said you saw something. The only way to confront the darkness to find out what it wants is to get as close to death as possible."" Lottie soothes Travis, they both fall asleep, and in the night Travis drives to the ranch where he works, apparently leaving Lottie instructions of how to get into his bank account. Lottie somehow guesses he's gone to the ranch, finds him in the barn, and says, ""He had lit candles around him in the shape of the symbol."" She helps Travis in his dangerous quest, but it goes wrong and he dies by suicide. Lottie leaves one part of out of her story: she sees Laura Lee's ghost in the barn.""I didn't kill him, Nat. I was trying to save him,"" Lottie says. So, is Lottie telling the truth about what happened to Travis? Did she really try to help him? Was it an accident? Why didn't Lottie try other ways to save Travis? Does it have anything to do with Camp Green Pine? As Natalie says, ""I know there's something you're not telling me.""There's plenty more ahead \u2014 we'll keep you updated every week on all things Lottie.

Here is a list of international resources.",'Yellowjackets' Season 2: What's the deal with Lottie's cult?,"For the entirety of Yellowjackets Season 1, we had no idea whether Lottie (Courtney Eaton) was alive in the present day. But in the season finale, we finally got confirmation she'd made it through the wilderness.What's Lottie been doing for 25 years since they were finally rescued from the wilderness? Amid Natalie (Juliette Lewis) and Misty's (Christina Ricci) investigations into the suspicious death of Travis (Andres Soto), we find out Lottie (Simone Kessell) was the one responsible for draining his bank account after he died. How is Lottie connected to Travis's death? What's her plan with all of his cash?\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Yellowjackets' burning questions we have going into Season 2\n            \n\n\nWell, in Season 2, we finally catch up with Lottie, who appears to be running a cult \u2014 sorry, a wellness retreat \u2014 called Camp Green Pine. What exactly is this place? Who are these purple-clad people? Here's everything we know so far, and we'll be updating this each week with additional details revealed per episode.What happened to Lottie after the Yellowjackets were rescued?\n\n\n\n\nWhere's Lottie been?\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nLottie's return to society was not a smooth one. We get a glimpse into the team's 1998 return in the second season's first episode, as we see the girls herded past one hungry press horde. Since their return, Lottie hasn't uttered a word. She spends her nights silently wandering around her parents' home, so they have her committed to a psychiatric facility. During a session of electroconvulsive therapy, Lottie experiences flashbacks to her visions from the wilderness, and later in her hospital room she uses her ""healing hand"" breathing technique to calm her roommate's anxiety attack, like she did multiple times with Travis in the woods. It seems Lottie may have been inspired by her own confidence in her healing abilities to open a dedicated facility...in the woods.What's the nature of Lottie's wellness retreat?\n\n\n\n\nLottie's gone back into the woods, sort of.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nWhen we first meet Lottie as an adult, she's giving a motivational talk from a minimalist wooden stage in a stunning lakeside location, near a woods. She's orating to an audience completely dressed in shades of purple \u2014 ""It\u2019s heliotrope, it\u2019s not purple,"" Lottie insists. ""We make the dye ourselves from the flowers used to treat wounds."" \u2014 while she's dressed in bright orange. I'm just saying, it's the same hue as the followers of Rajneeshpuram, the commune established in rural Oregon in the 1980s that formed the focus of Netflix's Wild Wild Country. Do with that what you will.""There's only one person who can really give you what you're looking for: You. Your truest, most authentic self. That's why you're here, so I can introduce you,"" Lottie tells her audience. ""Right now there is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self. And there is nothing more painful than hiding that self.""\n\n\n\n\n""There is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self.""\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nBut so far, there's no cult-like activity at Camp Green Pine. Lottie appears to be running a pretty standard holistic mental health retreat for people seeking therapy for trauma or to process negative emotions. In episode 2, when questioned by Natalie, Lottie calmly explains, ""We are not a cult. We are an intentional community turning suffering into strength so we can live as our best selves.""Chickens roam freely among the camp's curated grounds, residents sit in quiet conversation around the communal bonfire when they're not in their fancy cabins, and late at night, they engage in ritualistic faux burials wearing animal masks and white robes \u2014 or sometimes nothing at all. ""A therapeutic treatment, one of many we offer here,"" Lottie explains in episode 2. Who knows if there's a quiz night? But it's not all Goopy woo-woo wellness vibes all the time, as Lottie momentarily loses her chill over something so small as a health shake ingredient. When her associate Lisa (Nicole Maines) brings her daily shake, she quietly reprimands her. ""I smell butterscotch, did you put maca root in here? Hmm. I asked for ashwagandha. I want my focus increased, not my libido."" Feigning she's fine with it as Natalie is present, Lottie then promptly throws her shake, in a reusable cup with reusable straw, in the garbage.But there's one thing at Camp Green Pine it appears Lottie brought back from the woods: that dreaded symbol.\n\n\n\n\nLottie seems to have borrowed a little somethin' from the wilderness.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nThe seemingly apotropaic icon we've seen all series immediately comes into play in episode 1, when Natalie notices it being worn as a pendant by Lisa: ""That thing around your neck tells me all I need to know.""Why did Lottie's group kidnap Natalie?\n\n\n\n\nNot a gentle introduction.\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nEssentially, Lottie's community members kidnapped Natalie to save her life. But they didn't save her...gently. In the first season's finale, a group of purple-clad people burst into Natalie's hotel room just as she's about to kill herself, dragging her into a van marked with the symbol from the wilderness. In Season 2's first episode, Natalie is being held captive in a wooden cabin, where she's restrained by the wrists. Why does Lottie have bed cuffs installed in her accommodation? ""We were afraid you were going to hurt yourself,"" says Lisa, who has been assigned to supervise Natalie. It appears to be the type of physical restraint used in psychiatric facilities, and as Natalie realises, it's not a regular practice residents like Lisa are used to at all. But Camp Green Pine's real ""Hotel California"" energy comes into play when Natalie violently escapes her cabin cell, as followers in purple pursue her through the woodsy darkness, calling out, ""Hey, get back here!"" Not exactly welcoming, huh?How did Lottie's cult begin in the wilderness?\n\n\n\n\n""I have a bad feeling about this place.""\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nLottie's journey toward becoming the Yellowjackets' spiritual leader in the wilderness runs a steady pace in Season 1, but hasn't quite been defined yet in Season 2. Though Lottie's initial connection to spirituality seems loose in Season 1, her increasingly prominent ""visions"" define her experience in the wilderness, from her French-speaking outburst during the attic seance to Jackie finding her standing in the lake in her PJs, not to mention her underwater premonition of Laura Lee's explosive death. Lottie is the first Yellowjacket to find one of the series' signature spooky symbols carved into a tree, and she dons a crown of antlers in the ""Doomcoming"" episode, all but confirming she's the Antler Queen from the Season 1's opening scene of ritualistic cannibalism.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\n\n\nTripping on Misty's mushrooms, Lottie easily leads several fellow Yellowjackets into a bacchanal of screaming, howling girls who pursue Travis for their own hedonistic, violent, and possibly sacrificial means. During their psychedelic journey, Lottie says aloud, ""We won't be hungry much longer."" The next day, she confronts a bear that wanders near their cabin and seemingly kneels before her so she can kill it.

cdebdd07-ef7f-4a3e-b348-be8497a09143,"'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for March 31 - If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\u201cKwordle.\u201d It should rhyme with \u201cWordle,\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like ""curdle.\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\u2019ve narrowed it down to \u201c-IGHT,\u201d you could guess \u201cMIGHT\u201d \u201cNIGHT\u201d \u201cLIGHT\u201d and \u201cSIGHT\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \u201chard mode.\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \u201cNOTES,\u201d \u201cACRID,\u201d and \u201cLUMPY.\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \u201cCANOE,\u201d \u201cSKIRT,\u201d \u201cPLUMB,\u201d and \u201cFUDGY.\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?One word has a double letter.What do today\u2019s Quordle words start with?C, T, S, and P.What are the answers for today\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

Streaming our favorite content is good, entertaining fun, no doubt \u2014 but according to the latest ""While You Were Streaming"" report from Truth Initiative, a whopping 60 percent of the 15 most popular TV shows among 15 to 24-year-olds contained depictions of tobacco use in 2021, exposing 25 million young people to smoking and vaping imagery that puts them at risk for nicotine addiction.\xa0Research shows high exposure to on-screen tobacco imagery \u2014 and the glamorization of it \u2014 poses a serious public health threat to young people, making them three times more likely to start vaping nicotine in the first place. With these products being shown all around us, we should be very concerned given that the CDC reported over 2.5 million middle school and high school students were using e-cigarettes in 2022 with 46 percent of high school students who vape nicotine doing so almost daily.

Research shows that nicotine can amplify feelings of anxiety and depression and increase stress levels.\xa0In case you need help connecting the dots between vaping and mental health, here's a quick rundown: Within minutes of using a nicotine vape, you might feel less anxious. That's because nicotine is stimulating your brain's release of dopamine, a naturally occurring chemical messenger that's part of your body's rewards system \u2014 but the good feelings don't last long. The dopamine wears off fast and the more you vape nicotine, the more you condition your body to crave the release of dopamine from nicotine. Skip vaping for a few hours and you might start spiraling. A quick vape hit might level you out, but skip another few hours and you're back to spiraling. Essentially, vaping nicotine can turn fresh air into stress air.Tools to help you quit and stay quitThe human brain is still developing until around the age of 25, making young people more susceptible to nicotine addiction. The trick is to be aware of the facts, and truth has loads of resources, including their This is Quitting program, to give you tips, strategies, and inspiration to live vape-free.

This comes on the heels of an open letter signed by major figures in AI, including Elon Musk, which called for a six-month pause on the training of systems more powerful than GPT-4.The complaint asks the Commission ""to initiate an investigation into OpenAI and find that the commercial release of GPT-4 violates Section 5 of the FTC Act.""

After all, how many indie developers can afford $42,000 per month?\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the official Twitter Developer account shared details regarding pricing of its new API plan. The API basically provides third-party applications and developers with access to the social media platform's data and features. The company also emailed details of the new AI plan to developers.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nAccording to Twitter, free access to the API \u200bwill only allow developers to write 1,500 tweets per month. The new free tier of the API no longer includes the ability for developers to access tweets, only create them.To compare, Twitter's old free plan, called ""Elevated,"" currently allows developers to access 2 million tweets per month.Twitter offers two plans at wildly different price pointsAs for the paid plan, there is one tier called Basic, which Twitter classifies as being for hobbyists or students. This plan costs $100 per month and only allows access to 10,000 tweets per month. One can also write 50,000 tweets per month with this plan.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\nAgain, this new paid plan is much less than the previous free plan's limits. Most apps using the Twitter API that have a few regular users are going to exceed these limits rather quickly, if they aren't already.So, what's the next step up? The Enterprise plans, which Mashable previously reported on, which start at $42,000 per month.That's right. There's currently no announced plan between the $100 per month Basic tier and the $42,000 per month starting price for the Enterprise plans. As of now, if you outgrow the $100 plan, you'll need to upgrade to the $42,000 per month plan.\n\n\n\n\nThe email from Twitter sent to developers breaking down the subscription options for Twitter's new API plans.\nCredit: Mashable Screenshot\n\n\nElon Musk says the new API pricing is being implemented to kill off the bots, but looking at the reaction on Twitter, it's more like armageddon for any indie developer who runs actually useful Twitter apps. Numerous developers have already announced that the new API pricing structure basically forces them to shut down their Twitter-based apps.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n""With new Twitter API prices I'm sad to announce the end of TwittExplorer \U0001f622,"" tweeted @Pauline_Cx.\n\n        Tweet may have been deleted\n        (opens in a new tab)\n\n\n""Updated my Twitter bio to reflect current events,"" tweeted @adamlyttleapps, alongside a screenshot of his new Twitter bio indicating he will no longer be working on his TopFollowers.io Twitter app.Many apps will change or disappear completelyDevelopers running apps that use the Twitter API, but are not entirely based on it, also announced some major changes.""This is sad \U0001f613,"" tweeted @SimonHoiberg, who runs a social media management app called FeedHive.

At publishing time, only five app developers said they could afford to stay open under Twitter's planned API changes.Killing off the third-party app ecosystem is a shortsighted move from Musk and company.

Unfortunately, Twitter's new API pricing plan has now killed his app.And unlike some others who are waiting to see what happens as Twitter closes the old API access over the next 30 days, @remotejoeclark was forced to shut down his app and issue refunds to customers immediately. Why? Because he upgraded to the new Basic API plan as soon as he could and Twitter immediately locked him out because the app already had exceeded that month's tweet allotment under the prior API offering. At that point, he already had to make a choice: pay $42,000 or close up shop.How much do indie developers earn?Many indie developers don't make all that much from their apps. On Twitter, you'll often find developers trying to hit a goal of making $1,000, $2,000, $5,000, or maybe even $10,000 per month from their project in the hopes of being able to make it a self-sustaining full-time job. At $42,000, Twitter is not just making those goals unattainable for indie developers, it's also making its chances at a profitable future more difficult too.

While there is no word yet on the dates for the second 2023 Big Smile event, it's likely to also have similar timing, so should take place some time this Spring.

9c6fa4d8-245a-4aef-a455-2b3f5d568875,"Why we enjoy being humiliated during sex - You\u2019re on a leash, on the floor, being told you\u2019re a disgusting animal. Your partner puts a high heeled shoe up to your face and demands you kiss their foot.\xa0You do it.\xa0They bring out a paddle and give you a spanking. They spit on you. You endure it. You\u2019ve never been more turned on in your life.\xa0Welcome to the world of erotic humiliation play. You\u2019re going to have so much fun here.Being humiliated in non-sexual scenarios is a huge driving force behind a lot of our anxieties. We loathe being embarrassed or made to feel small. It fucking sucks.\xa0But in sex, it can feel like the opposite. BDSM often is a safe place to work through and play with our biggest fears and anxieties. It\u2019s a way to take back a bit of control in a world that can feel like pure chaos. Humiliation during sex is at its core, ""eroticizing or getting pleasure from words or activities that elicit feelings of embarrassment, shame, or humiliation,"" says Zachary Zane, author of Boyslut: A Memoir and Manifesto, and sex expert for Momentum Intimacy. ""You get a rush response when you're called certain names or do [certain things], and people enjoy that heightened sensation in a sexual context.""\xa0Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.Remember in Succession when Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) \u2014 mommy, btw \u2014  went off on one to Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) about what a disgusting little pig he was while he jerked off in the bathroom? He was massively into being humiliated. It was the thing that was getting him off. The more horrible the things she said, the more into it he became. Arguably one of the hottest scenes in modern television history, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Succession's 'ludicrously capacious bag' becomes ludicrously capacious meme\n            \n\n\nMaking shame sexy. Who knew?If you\u2019re feeling a bit ~titillated~, you\u2019re certainly in good company. This practice is huge in the kink world. In a study of cis-gendered women affiliated with the kink community, almost 43 percent enjoyed verbal abuse or humiliation and almost 26 percent enjoyed humiliating their partner in the same way. Erotic humiliation can be enjoyed by anyone, of any gender, of any sexual orientation.Let\u2019s explore what humiliation really is in BDSM, why people are so wild about it, and how to practice it safely (if you\u2019re down to clown).What humiliation play is in a kink context.Humiliation play is incorporating humiliation into your sexual and/or BDSM practice. ""It is a form of consensual psychological humiliation that can be physical, verbal, and emotional,"" explains Dr. Lee Phillips, a psychotherapist and certified sex and couples therapist. ""It is common in submissive/dominant relationships and it falls under the BDSM umbrella of sadomasochism.""You literally become sexually aroused by being degraded.OK, a quick refresher on what BDSM is \u2014 because if we don\u2019t understand this aspect, humiliation play makes zero sense. BDSM stands for Bondage, Discipline/Dominance, Submission, Masochism. This kind of play hinges on consensual powerplay wherein the Dominant partner leads and the submissive partner follows.\xa0\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            A beginner's guide to understanding Dom/sub dynamics\n            \n\n\nIn the context of erotic humiliation, the powerplay is focused on degradation. The Dom humiliates the sub in a safe and consensual way. ""Humiliation-play can take place in the bedroom during sex, but sex does not have to be incorporated,"" Philips says. ""For example, crawling on your hands and knees with something in your mouth [and] bringing it to your Dom as they talk down to you is seen as humiliation-play.""Humiliation can be a part of all BDSM dynamics. It\u2019s about the intention. It\u2019s an act within the play itself. It may be present in:Psychological kink playSuch as verbal insults/degrading languagePunishments and painplaySuch as spankings, being tied up, slapped, or spit on.Role playSuch as classic Dom/sub leather dynamics, Human/animal play, Caregiver/little (Daddy/little girl, Mommy/little boy etc.)Why do people crave humiliation during sex?We\u2019re into humiliation during sex for many reasons. Because humans are hella complicated.Shameful messages around sex.""We learn about sex in a way that links sexuality with shame. Whether told directly or absorbed indirectly through culture, most of us hear far more about who and what we \u2018shouldn\u2019t\u2019 do, the risks involved, and the potential damage (real or imagined) our sexual behaviors may cause,"" explains Sarah Melancon, Ph.D, a sociologist, clinical sexologist, and resident expert at The Sex Toy Collective.\n    We learn about sex in a way that links sexuality with shame.\n    \nDespite this negative messaging, we still have sexual feelings. We\u2019re human, after all. When our natural feelings are coupled with the messaging that sex is wrong and shameful, it can ""cause us to purposefully bring feelings of shame or embarrassment to the surface and [this] can heighten arousal for many,"" Melancon says.\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            How to explore a praise kink\n            \n\n\nOf course, we also have deeply personal insecurities that play into this. For example, if you\u2019re insecure about your penis size, you may enjoy small-penis humiliation play. Your turn-on comes from your shame being eroticized.\xa0Giving up control.Additionally, embracing erotic humiliation can be an act of deep surrender for the submissive partner, says Julieta Chiaramonte, a kink instructor and sex expert.

""This is why usually very high-level CEOs or dominant people in their normal life may love being called unworthy and walking like a dog on a leash at night,"" Chiaramonte says. ""It\u2019s relaxing, it\u2019s taboo, and it\u2019s hot to experiment in the shadow of humanity.""Building intimacy.Ironically, being humiliated during sex can actually be used to deepen your bond with your partner. ""You're very vulnerable when being humiliated,"" Zane says. To engage in such a highly emotive form of play suggests a relationship that is deeply steeped in trust.Safety and consent are key to safe play.As with all sexual play, safety and consent are absolutely essential to playing in an ethical and enjoyable way. Remember, just because the play is centered around degradation doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re looking to harm one another. Enthusiastic consent is a must. If it isn\u2019t a hell yeah, it\u2019s a hell no. \n    If it isn\u2019t a hell yeah, it\u2019s a hell no. \n\n    \nChiaramonte suggests having a conversation with your partner in 3 steps. This should be done in a neutral, non-sexual space before play begins.\xa0Here is my desire: ""I would love to try some humiliation play, let me tell you more about it.""This is why I desire it: ""I think it would be really hot to be called X, Y, Z, and maybe wear a leash. This makes me feel super dominated.""This is why I would love to try it with you: ""I really trust you, enjoy our intimacy, and think it would be fun to experiment with this. How do you feel about it?""\nSEE ALSO:\n\n            KinkTok is rife with misinformation. Here's why that's dangerous.\n            \n\n\nHumiliation play looks different for everyone. ""Humiliation-play is based on your own perceptions and experiences,"" Philips says. You want to be clear on what you want and how you want it, so that everyone has the opportunity to play in a way that feels safe and pleasurable for them.3 expert-approved tips for getting started.Get really clear about language and boundaries.\xa0You want to know exactly what is and is not on the table because what works for someone may be highly specific. ""Perhaps you like the words 'slut,' and 'whore' but don't like being called a 'bitch,'"" Zane says. ""You need to communicate that to your partner.""You don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t ask for. ""If you don\u2019t directly tell your partner you want to be called a dirty slut and have your hair pulled, it won\u2019t happen,"" Chiaramonte adds. ""We get what we want when we can clearly ask for it.""Have a safe word.Now, sometimes, we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t like until we get to that boundary. That\u2019s OK. We\u2019re experimenting a lot of the time. This is where a safe word comes in. ""Always have a safe word, so if you're not enjoying the experience, you can communicate to your partner that you'd like to stop immediately,"" Zane says. Your safe word should be a non-sexual word that means: ""The boundary has been reached. Stop."" Some examples include: Red, sailboat, evergreen, cupcake, etc.Don\u2019t forget aftercare.Aftercare is the come-down time after a scene finishes. It\u2019s a chance to recalibrate, relax, and reconnect with your partner. ""Aftercare can take many forms, but often, it includes cuddling, kind words, and rehydration,"" Zane says. Because erotic humiliation is so intense and consists of a lot of things we wouldn\u2019t want in IRL, we need to make space to contain our emotions and come back down to earth in a safe and gentle way.",Why we enjoy being humiliated during sex,"You\u2019re on a leash, on the floor, being told you\u2019re a disgusting animal. Your partner puts a high heeled shoe up to your face and demands you kiss their foot.\xa0You do it.\xa0They bring out a paddle and give you a spanking. They spit on you. You endure it. You\u2019ve never been more turned on in your life.\xa0Welcome to the world of erotic humiliation play. You\u2019re going to have so much fun here.Being humiliated in non-sexual scenarios is a huge driving force behind a lot of our anxieties. We loathe being embarrassed or made to feel small. It fucking sucks.\xa0But in sex, it can feel like the opposite. BDSM often is a safe place to work through and play with our biggest fears and anxieties. It\u2019s a way to take back a bit of control in a world that can feel like pure chaos. Humiliation during sex is at its core, ""eroticizing or getting pleasure from words or activities that elicit feelings of embarrassment, shame, or humiliation,"" says Zachary Zane, author of Boyslut: A Memoir and Manifesto, and sex expert for Momentum Intimacy. ""You get a rush response when you're called certain names or do [certain things], and people enjoy that heightened sensation in a sexual context.""\xa0Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox?

d80109d5-ee63-405c-b4d8-0aeae0d6a9a8,"Amazon's latest Fire 7 tablet meets the tepid expectations set by its $60 price point - Sixty bucks doesn't go as far as it once did. That's less than six months of Disney+ (with ads) after its latest price hike, or a 10th of a Taylor Swift ticket in the nosebleeds (depending on the city and your luck). It costs $10 more to buy a new first-party video game nowadays. But $60 can still get you a tablet \u2014\xa0not the best tablet, but a tablet.The latest Amazon Fire 7 is a June 2022 refresh of the company's smallest and most popular Alexa-enabled tablet, and it's priced at just $59.99 for the 16GB base model with ads on its lockscreen. That's a $10 price bump from the 2019 version in exchange for a faster quad-core processor, double the RAM, USB-C charging, and three more hours of battery life. After spending a week with the Fire 7, I can confirm that none of those ""upgrades"" made a dramatic dent in its aggressive mediocrity. It's still a putzy little tablet with some annoying proprietary features that often make a case against it. That being said, I'll still go to bat for the Fire 7 as a passable portable entertainment device or a toe-dip into the Amazon Fire ecosystem. Its shortcomings are almost beside the point. Like, yeah \u2014\xa0it's $60. What did you expect?What's new: Nothing drasticAmazon's external tweaks to the 12th-generation Fire 7 were pretty minor; this was more of a freshening-up than a facelift. For starters, its 7-inch touchscreen has slightly slimmer but still-thick bezels and an identical resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels. It's solid for streaming shows and playing light games, if a tad too reflective, but it makes small text in app icons and e-books appear fuzzy. I found it a little distracting when I first started reading Spare in the Kindle app, but my eyes eventually adjusted to a point where it was tolerable. It seemed to help when I set the tablet to its system-wide dark theme, a new feature that launched in last year's Fire OS update. The white-on-black mode boldens the text a teense.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fire 7's reflective screen means any photo of it is also a selfie.\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\n\n\nThe new Fire 7's 2MP front camera scooted over to the larger bezel to better support landscape video calls, but it still caps out at 720p HD (as does the rear-facing one), and pictures look grainy unless you're working with a good amount of natural light. It's definitely geared toward impromptu reference shots, not portraits you want to frame or post on main.As far as overall build quality goes, Amazon claims the new Fire 7 has tested ""twice as durable"" as the latest iPad mini in tumble tests. I'm not about to drop-kick either device onto the sidewalk, but for its part, I think the Fire 7 could walk away mostly unscathed, especially if it's wearing one of Amazon's compatible fabric covers (sold separately). The plastic back shell is a little cheapo compared to the aluminum of an Apple-made tablet, but it still doesn't make it feel like a toy. \n\n\n\n\nI took these two photos of my parrot Melon with the Amazon Fire 7's rear- and front-facing cameras (left to right). Neither is much to squawk about.\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\n\n\nFor what it's worth, this new model's shell also comes in a couple new colors: In addition to the standard black finish, there's now a light pink ""rose"" and a dark blue ""denim."" I sort of miss the jewel tones of the previous generation \u2014 these new ones are very much giving gender reveal party (derogatory).One thing I really wish Amazon would improve the next time it revisits the Fire 7 is its mono speaker: This thing sounds gnarly. The best way I can describe it is that it sounds like you're filtering the audio through one of those 1994 Baywatch Barbie dolphins \u2014 kind of crunchy, kind of twangy. This was also something I was able to get used to as I spent more time with the tablet, but it was a jump-scare the first time I hit ""play"" on a podcast. (The Fire 7 does come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and Bluetooth support, so you don't necessarily have to rely on it.) More storage and battery life, but still-pokey performanceLet's get into some of Amazon's bigger promises for the new Fire 7. I'll start things off on a positive note with its storage capacity of 16GB or 32GB, which is now expandable to up to 1TB with a separate microSD card. (The 2019 model peaked at 512GB of expandable memory.) This is the one thing on its spec sheet that genuinely wowed me, and it could be a big selling point for anyone with a large personal media library they want to take on the go. That's a ton of space for a device you can easily toss in a backpack pocket or purse.Battery-wise, Amazon says you're now working with up to 10 hours per charge instead of seven. (You can also charge it via USB-C, which is a convenient, new feature for the Fire 7 line.) I was only able to squeak out eight during my testing, but that's probably because I had it doing a lot of heavier tasks like streaming and gaming; you'll hit closer to that 10-hour mark if you stick to mostly browsing and reading. I should note that there was no battery drain when I set the tablet aside in sleep mode for an hour, which is an improvement from the previous generation. I definitely wouldn't worry about it conking out during a flight.On the flip side, the Fire 7's ""upgraded"" performance fails to impress in practice. As mentioned, it now runs on a quad-core 2.0 GHz processor (up from 1.3 GHz) and 2GB of RAM (up from 1GB), which is supposed to make it 30 percent faster than its predecessor. That may be true \u2014\xa0I haven't tried the older model \u2014\xa0but there's still no denying that this cheap tablet performs like a cheap tablet. There's a slight delay after tapping buttons and an obvious choppiness to scrolling through apps, including native ones like Prime Video and Audible. Movies and games play smoothly once they finally load in, but social media apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook struggle to keep up as I descend my feeds. I feel like I need to apologize to the thing every time I pull up TikTok \u2014\xa0it's like sensory overload for its system.To the Fire 7's credit, it's extremely cool that a $60 device is capable of doing everything I just listed. It's just clear that it hates being hustled through it.The Amazon of it allAmazon likened the Fire 7's durability to that of an iPad mini in its press release, but beyond that and their general appearance, they're very different devices. I'm honestly not even sure if it's fair to compare Fire tablets with other name-brand Android-based tablets. The inherent Amazon-ness of their proprietary features effectively turns them into a whole separate species of device \u2014\xa0sometimes to their detriment.\n\n\n\n\nThere's no question who makes this tablet.\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\n\n\nTake the operating system, for example. All Fire devices run on a custom-made Android fork called Fire OS, which revolves heavily around Amazon content. This is fine if you're someone who's embraced that ecosystem, but as someone who hasn't, I found it a little heavy-handed and off-putting. It's probably even more obnoxious if you opt for the base Fire 7, which displays ""special offers"" for Amazon products and services on its lockscreen. My testing unit was the ad-free version, so I can't speak personally to the sponsored Fire tablet experience, but Mashable reviewers have called it ""loathesome"" and ""spammy"" in the past.In a similar vein, Fire tablets also come with an exclusive app store \u2014 the aptly named Amazon Appstore \u2014 which has a limited selection compared to the standard Google Play library for Android. I was able to find most of my go-tos, but YouTube, Reddit, Google Maps, and Gmail were some glaring omissions that I could only access via webpage. (It's not a total dealbreaker, but it's certainly inconvenient.) Manual sideloading is a workaround, supposedly, but that's a Whole Thing I didn't want to get into.And then there's Alexa. Amazon's virtual assistant is pre-installed in all Fire tablets, and the Fire 7 has worked hands-free with it since the previous generation. I don't love the idea of my technology always listening to me, but the Alexa in my tester earned props for being able to tell me the weather and shuffle through the new Lana del Rey album while I was busy doing my makeup. Still, I probably wouldn't make it a regular part of my day: It went out of its way to involve Amazon services in its answers, and it got tripped up by some seemingly easy commands. Funnily enough, ""Alexa, turn off your microphone"" was one of them \u2014 sore subject?Portable entertainment for penny-pinchersI probably sound like a hater, but at the end of the day, I think the Fire 7's value negates almost any criticism I try to throw at it. Sure, its performance is deeply average and it comes with some proprietary quirks, but it's fully capable of doing most tablet-y things, and you're only paying $60 for it. That price point is basically a Get Out of Jail Free card for all of its faults. It could never compete in the same league as an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Tab, or even most smartphones, but it was never meant to. It's not perfect, but ""fine"" is acceptable for the money. The most important thing is just knowing what you're getting.\n\n\n\n\nRe-watching ""Girls"" in bed in a pitch-black room: That's the Millennial Experience\u2122\ufe0f, baby.\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\n\n\nI think the Fire 7's strongest competition is actually the older model from 2019: You're probably not going to notice a substantial downgrade in speed or power, and you could put your leftover $10 toward a battery pack that'll keep it powered way longer than 10-ish hours. Unless you're in dire need of a whole terabyte of storage, I wouldn't upgrade if you already own this version, personally.Things get a little more interesting if you introduce some wiggle room to your budget. For a similarly versatile tablet with notably improved specs, the latest Fire HD 8 offers a hexa-core processor, double the native storage, dual speakers, and a slightly larger display. If you're going to use your device primarily for e-reading, the new Kindle features a nicer glare-free screen and up to six weeks of battery life. Both clock in at $99.99 (with ads), and it's easy to make the case that the extra $30 is worth it.If you value affordability and portability above all, I'll leave you with an insider tip: Amazon has put the new Fire 7 on sale for just $39.99 before. It probably won't happen much outside of shopping holidays like Prime Day and Black Friday, but if you keep a close eye out, I can guarantee it'll be easier to snag than Eras Tour seats.",Amazon's latest Fire 7 tablet meets the tepid expectations set by its $60 price point,"Sixty bucks doesn't go as far as it once did. That's less than six months of Disney+ (with ads) after its latest price hike, or a 10th of a Taylor Swift ticket in the nosebleeds (depending on the city and your luck). It costs $10 more to buy a new first-party video game nowadays. But $60 can still get you a tablet \u2014\xa0not the best tablet, but a tablet.The latest Amazon Fire 7 is a June 2022 refresh of the company's smallest and most popular Alexa-enabled tablet, and it's priced at just $59.99 for the 16GB base model with ads on its lockscreen. That's a $10 price bump from the 2019 version in exchange for a faster quad-core processor, double the RAM, USB-C charging, and three more hours of battery life. After spending a week with the Fire 7, I can confirm that none of those ""upgrades"" made a dramatic dent in its aggressive mediocrity. It's still a putzy little tablet with some annoying proprietary features that often make a case against it. That being said, I'll still go to bat for the Fire 7 as a passable portable entertainment device or a toe-dip into the Amazon Fire ecosystem. Its shortcomings are almost beside the point. Like, yeah \u2014\xa0it's $60.

2a454f60-dd8f-416d-8a6b-622dc40e8057,"A good pair of noise-canceling headphones are a necessity when you're on an airplane — here are our favorites - Flying has never had a reputation for being the most stress-free way to travel. In 2023, more people are prioritizing their vacations as a way to really unwind and disconnect from the stresses of day-to-day life \u2014 but starting your travels on a noisy hours-long flight with nothing to do but ride it out isn't exactly conducive to that goal. Once you factor in that record numbers of people are traveling by plane, it's clear that doing what you can to alleviate your stress from the get-go is essential. Enter: noise-canceling headphones. Even if you're not a frequent flyer, getting a pair of headphones that can block out the sounds of a roaring engine, crying babies, or crying adults (flight delays are stressful), can make or break your travel experience. The good news is plenty of headphones, both over the ear and earbuds alike, offer active noise cancelation these days. While having options means you don't have to pay a lot to get in on that sweet, sweet ANC, those price differences aren't without reason. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            What to look for when shopping for the best headphones\n            \n\n\nSome headphones, for instance, offer different levels of noise cancelation, and transparency modes that allow you to keep them on while being able to hear what's going on around you. Let's not forget that ANC on its own won't save the day \u2014 otherwise we'd just direct you to our best noise-canceling headphones. Comfort can be key too. It won't matter if your headphones block sound out well if you only want to wear them for two out of five hours of your flight. And for those who wouldn't mind investing simultaneously in their in-flight headphones and general in-life headphones, a few extra features \u2014 like balanced sound and voice assistance \u2014 can't hurt.With that in mind, we've rounded up some of the best headphones for flying to make taking all of those factors into consideration way less stressful than heading to the airport. But before we get into our picks, we've answered some questions on what you need to know before making a purchase.\xa0Does paying more really get me more noise cancellation?Generally, yes. Many earphones and headphones offer noise-cancellation features but they aren't all the same. Typically, the more you pay and the better known and regarded the brand is, the better the noise cancellation is. Brands like Bose or Sony often offer multiple different levels of noise cancellation so you can choose to be completely blocked off from the world or opt to allow some surrounding noises to come in while flying.\xa0As we mentioned, investing more can get you some nice features to supplement your ANC, like voice assistant support, expansive battery life, advanced codec support for better-sounding music, or better call quality. If you're a frequent flyer, the cost is almost certainly worth it. Do noise-canceling headphones help on airplanes?Noise-canceling headphones are at their most useful on airplanes. While flying, it's difficult to find a moment's peace when so much is going on around you. Frequent flyers may prefer to rest or work despite airplane noise distracting them. The best way to do this is by using the best noise cancellation methods to block out what's going on.\xa0With that in mind, some headphones' ANC works best on blocking out people talking more than ambient engine sounds, and vice versa.Do noise-canceling headphones help with flight anxiety?It depends on why you have flight anxiety. If you hate the idea of being \u201cstuck\u201d on a plane, it might not work as well as if it's the noises that cause you anxiety. However, by being able to zone out and listen to your favorite music or podcasts, you can forget that you're on an airplane as you won't notice you're flying in the same way as if you hear all the surrounding noises.Similarly, if you hate flying because of ambient noise like children crying or loud talking, noise-canceling headphones can help hide this away from your ears, meaning you can relax better. With a combination of meditative sounds and music, the best noise-canceling headphones can whisk you away from irritants. Effectively, you can cocoon yourself away from the reminders that you're traveling.We've included something for everyone, from popular brands like Sony, Beats, and Apple.

Games don't just emerge from the ether to make kids smile; they're the product of difficult labor and, occasionally, geopolitical anxiety. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            'Tetris' review: This movie is far better than it has any right to be\n            \n\n\nThat's the boldest move Tetris makes, bolder than even trying to T-spin your way out of a jam with a high score on the line. For most of its runtime, this is a movie about men in suits negotiating for IP rights. Contracts are drafted, signed, voided, faxed, shredded, and all the other fun things you can do with a contract. The core conflict here is 1980s capitalists versus Communists trying to get the best deal for their country (and maybe themselves, individually) in the USSR's twilight years.What Tetris lacks in factual realism (one of its subjects has admitted as much), it makes up for in convincingly examining the inner lives of the people responsible for bringing joy to countless players over the last 30 years. Behind his madcap, Reagan-era Wall Street persona, businessman Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) is a tremendously hard-working dude who sees a golden opportunity to set his kids up financially for life by licensing the game for global release. Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov), meanwhile, is torn between wanting to break the rules of Soviet society for his own (deserved) gain and wanting to keep his wife and kids safe.The interplay between these two men ultimately leads to the best scene in Tetris. Rogers, on a business trip to Moscow, wants nothing more than to commune with the man who made this perfect video game. His distinctly capitalist persistence leads to a dinner date at Pajitnov's apartment, something Pajitnov initially hesitates to do because of local laws about sheltering foreigners. \n\n\n\n\nThe best scene in the movie.\nCredit: Apple\n\n\nAfter a somewhat icy dinner (with Pajitnov's wife astutely observing that Rogers is ""dumb but honest""), the two men retreat to Pajitnov's living room computer desk to play the titular game. Rogers notices something unsatisfying about the mechanics of Tetris: You can only clear one line of blocks at a time. He suggests allowing multiple lines to disappear at once. Pajitnov writes a few lines of code, and boom, Tetris as we know it is born.Amusingly, Pajitnov's explanation for why the game didn't work like that in the first place is that he just hadn't thought of it. All it took was another pair of eyes to create something beautiful. The two men then go on a lovely sojourn to a Moscow nightclub, where for the first time, we see Pajitnov crack a smile. Not only has he put the crucial finishing touches on his greatest creation, he's made a friend in the process.Is that moment cornball Hollywood nonsense? Kinda! But for decades, Hollywood has seen gaming as little more than an easy cash grab. Sure, I love the live-action Super Mario Bros. nightmare from 1993, but it's far from respectful to the source material and the people for whom the source material is a source of lifelong inspiration. \nSEE ALSO:\n\n            Tired of the Oscars? The 'On Cinema' Oscar special is the perfect alternative\n            \n\n\nThis one sequence in Tetris, which can't last longer than 15 minutes, has more reverence for gaming as both an artistic medium and a way to bring people together in it than the combined runtimes of almost every other game adaptation ever made. As a fan of video games, I don't want to see something I've already played get recreated in live action. If given the choice, I'd always rather see the conditions that led to the creation of a classic, and the real-world impact that that classic had as it swept the globe.Great art can be made in isolation, but greater art is made in collaboration. Here we see two men from opposite sides of the world, both literally and politically, coming together in a taboo fashion to make something special. They don't even realize it, but a tiny conversation in a dimly lit Soviet living room changed the course of video game history.Whether or not that moment played out exactly the same way in real life almost doesn't matter. It's genuinely heartening to watch barriers break down in a way that produces a stroke of creative genius. And, more broadly, it hammers home the point that video games, like all art, emerge from the trials of human existence. In this movie's version of history, Tetris became a cultural phenomenon because one guy wanted to feed his family and another guy wanted recognition for his work. Tetris is not an A+ film by any means, but in a world where Hollywood has so deeply misunderstood gaming for longer than I've been alive, that one living room scene makes me hopeful that future endeavors can build on what Tetris does right.Tetris premieres on AppleTV+ March 30.",'Tetris' appreciates the magic of making video games,"Tetris isn't quite as sublimely satisfying as watching the four-block pieces from its namesake neatly fall into place, but people making other video games movies should take some notes anyway.This is a perfectly OK film that explicitly understands that video games are cultural artifacts that are made by real people under real (and often extraordinary) circumstances.

I don't have *any* extracurriculars from high school, and since I was diagnosed with a chronic illness at the beginning of the year I wasn't able to focus too well on school, so I couldn't do well at school or have time for extracurriculars or work experience

I don't have any internships for this summer, but I was looking to actually get one for the summer between sophomore and junior year. I'm better now, so I really want to lock in and learn a LOT so I can do interesting projects that I can put on a resume.

I constructed a pathway for myself to follow, but I wanted others' advice on what I'm using to learn.   I tried to choose a general-purpose language and a scripting language, so I chose C++ because I heard it is way easier to learn any other language after you learn C++, and I chose Python because it's simply the most popular and I heard it's the most used in interviews.  I have a strict deadline of perhaps mid-August so I can start doing projects as SOON as possible so I can apply early, so that's basically four months between now and then. But here was my plan:

From now until the end of May:

1. Complete CS50 and Learncpp.com and freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing Python Certificate in about 31 days.
2. Go through Grokking's Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava in 22 days.

From the beginning of June until August (all items will be worked on at the same time:

1. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) for learning Data Structures
2. freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python in 24 days.
3. MIT Missing Semester

I'm not sure if these resources were all enough for me to consider applying. I'm not even sure if these are *good* resources, because I feel like every time I want to find a good resource to learn something there's one group of people who'll say this is good and another group who'll say this resource is absolutely terrible. Some of these I got from [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)'s FAQ and some are from posts in that subreddit as well.

(I have had offers from Tesla, SpaceX, Apple, Microsoft, and more) - TLDR, your resume is THE most important thing. Do something cool then make sure you portray it and yourself in a way that makes an employer want to hire you. 


Odds are, your resume needs fixing. If you’ve applied to hundreds of openings and still don’t have an internship or job - I hope this guide can help you. 

Using websites and tools I’ve linked below will get you very far with tailoring your resume to play the game of job applications. Most resumes aren't read by a real person until they pass through the automated systems. In addition, often the first person to see your resume may be non-technical so be sure to make things easy to understand. Don't go too in-depth. Having lots of numbers/figures will catch anyone's attention because everyone can understand these metrics. (Improved efficiency by 80%, cut costs by X%, saved the company $$$, etc, etc)


The best thing you can do to get started is read the wiki on r/engineeringresumes, then read many top posts on there, then post an anonymized copy of your own resume. You need to get some brutal and constructive criticism on your resume first.


Here are references and tools I use:

https://www.jobalytics.co/

https://resumeworded.com/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Engineeringresumes


For refining the keywords on my resume, jobalytics is probably my favorite.


Download the chrome extension, then make a word doc, or somewhere else you can start storing notes.


Upload your resume to the chrome extension, then go to LinkedIn and start searching for jobs you are interested in. Click on a listing, then use the chrome extension and have it tell you ""Words you are missing in your resume” copy and paste this list of ~10-15 words the word doc. Repeat this for ~10 job listings or so - continue to paste the missing words into a word doc.


After you have all of these words that you are missing, start looking for common trends in the words, or think about what words you can work on implementing into your resume.
Try to implement as many words as possible into your resume. 


After you are done, reupload your resume to the Chrome extension, and start looking at ~5-10 job postings again for keywords you are missing.


Repeat this until you are not missing many words. A good resume with metrics and meeting the keyword requirements is probably the most important thing to getting an interview. Getting past the automated screening is difficult with how many job applicants there are.


Once you have an interview: prep for it by going over all of the common questions that a company may ask: https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/index.html


On my resume, employers are always interested to hear about my 3D printing business / webtool I developed that has thousands of users. Being able to take an idea to production says a lot about a person. In addition, my internship and other work experience has allowed me to gain a lot of practical engineering knowledge outside of the classroom. They also loved seeing that I was active in an engineering club in my first semester of college. 


Companies are also always excited to see FSAE experience, solar car experience, rocket club experience, etc. Many students graduate with no experience, so the people working in these engineering clubs are at a major advantage as they’ve been doing actual engineering since their first semester of university. If your university has an engineering club that actually builds something, hardware or software, - join it asap and commit to working as many hours with it if you can. Your career prospects will thank you. 


After you get to the interview, someone thinks that you are qualified enough to have the position so they're going to primarily be seeing how you are at communicating, how you would react to problematic scenarios, how you would approach a problem, etc. Your resume, projects, etc will show that you have the technical knowledge and can apply it, but a business and internship need you to work on a team so they are testing you as a person.


I got my sophomore year internship at Tesla from an employee referral (another intern). Someone I had worked with in a project class during my first year of university. Knowing people and reaching out to alumni from your university at companies will get you very far. I know that there are more qualified people than me out there, but I may have never applied to this position if I hadn’t been referred. Networking is important.


After your resume is good, the rest is a numbers game. Depending on the economy, your previous experiences, etc, you may need to apply for 400+ internships. This is a numbers game - spend several hours per day applying to a wide variety of companies (especially if this is your first internship or job) 


Bonus tip: I’ve found that co-ops (6+ month internships) are easier to get as there are fewer students applying for them. Apply to them as a moonshot - if you get the offer, figure out what taking a semester off will do to your graduation schedule. Remember you can always take college courses online from many different universities during the school year, or over the summer. UND, ASU, UW Madison, etc, all offer lots of online engineering courses over the summer/some during the year.

I  am a senior and had to retake the class this semester, which I chose to  take with another professor hoping I would have a better experience  with the class.

The first midterm I  scored a 45 but did not notice the negative grade penalties he was  using at the time. For the 2nd midterm I studied my ass off and made a  31 which was very alarming. When I checked gradescope to see why I made  such a low grade, I saw that for every single question I answered  incorrectly, he docked my exam grade the total number of points that  question was worth instead of just giving no credit for incorrect  answers.

On the choose all that  apply questions, he docked my exam grade the total number of points the  question was worth PER incorrect selected answer (so if I selected 2-3  wrong on selected all that apply, grade was docked total amount that  question was worth x how many answers on that specific questions I  selected incorrectly).

When I sent  him an email this morning about it to get more clarification on the  negative grade penalties, his response was ""the negative penalties are  mentioned on the first page of the exam instructions"" instead of hearing  any of my concerns on this practice. I have NEVER taken a CS course or  any course at my university where we were docked negative points for  each incorrect answer from our grade.

I will be 29 years old  when I graduate next spring and if I don't make at least a C in this  class I can't take any of the classes I need to take to graduate at all  and would be taking random classes in the fall with only 1 semester left  after that.

I've been focused on taking courses and doing work in ML throughout my undergraduate years , as I want to eventually do applied ML work in industry in the future. I did a bit of research on how to get this position, and the general consensus seems to be that a Masters/PhD is required for the job.

I applied to several Masters programs in ML/AI a few months ago, and, although I'm still waiting on a few more results, I've been rejected to the majority of them, so it seems I'll need to go into industry and try reapplying in the future. However, it doesn't seem like I can get an ML job (because of the restrictions I mentioned above), and because I've been focusing on ML, my skills in other CS fields (data structures, databases, servers, etc.) are pretty lacking. Coupled with the fact that the news has been talking about layoffs in the tech industry recently, I'm pretty worried about my future and what it holds.

Should I start focusing on some non-ML field, and try to improve my skills in that field as fast as possible, so I can get a job there? I'm not sure how this would make me a better candidate if I do end up reapplying for a ML Masters program though. What are the best steps that I can take in my position if I eventually want to do applied ML in industry?

Thank you in advance for any advice!","Recent BS graduate focused on ML, but rejected from Masters programs"," Hello!
