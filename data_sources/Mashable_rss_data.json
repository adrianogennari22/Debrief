            "description": "By the time you're reading this, Twitter may or may not have already removed the blue checkmarks from its legacy verified users. Elon Musk announced last week that he planned on removing the verification badges from its 420,000 \"notable\" users on April 1.Following the legacy verified badge removal, the only way to get the little blue checkmark next to your Twitter name is by coughing up $8 per month (or $11 per month via mobile device) to Musk.However, many of the platform's most famous users have already made their intentions clear: They're not paying.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"Welp guess my blue \\u2714\\ufe0f will be gone soon cause if you know me I ain\\u2019t paying the 5. \\U0001f937\\U0001f3fe\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f\" tweeted NBA star LeBron James.William Shatner also tweeted that he was a no go for the move to Twitter Blue.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"Hey @elonmusk what\\u2019s this about blue checks going away unless we pay Twitter?,\" tweeted actor William Shatner. \"I\\u2019ve been here for 15 years giving my \\u23f0 & witty thoughts all for bupkis. Now you\\u2019re telling me that I have to pay for something you gave me for free? What is this-the Colombia Records & Tape Club?\\U0001f644\"And it's not just professional athletes and Hollywood actors sharing this sentiment either.According to Axios, The White House will also not be paying for Twitter Blue subscriptions. An internal staff email leaked to the outlet shared that the Joe Biden administration sees this change on Twitter as diminishing the value of the blue verification badge.\"It is our understanding that Twitter Blue does not provide person-level verification as a service. Thus, a blue check mark will now simply serve as a verification that the account is a paid user,\" said White House director of digital strategy Rob Flaherty in that email.Although, it does appear that official government accounts like the @WhiteHouse handle and @JoeBiden will still have the grey verification badge that Musk rolled out to denote a \"government\" account. These badges do not cost those users any money.Major news outlets also shared that they would not be purchasing Twitter Blue at the organization level or for individuals journalists and staffers. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, POLITICO, Vox, and BuzzFeed all shared statements declaring that they would not be paying for Twitter Blue. Each outlet said how the service changes the meaning of the badge and no longer designates an actually verified user on the platform.Actor Karl Urban chimed in on the matter as well, saying he's not paying for the Twitter Blue service.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"Hey y\\u2019all, I\\u2019ll loose the blue tick on Saturday,\" Urban tweeted. \"I\\u2019m opposed to spending money on social media. I\\u2019ll go checkless. Please be careful of Imposters & money soliciting scams. I will never ask you for money on any social media platform.\"Jason Alexander of Seinfeld fame not only said he wouldn't be paying for the blue checkmark, but he indicated that he would no longer be using the platform either.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"Friends, there are bigger issues in the \\U0001f30ethan the blue verified \\u2714\\ufe0fnext to my name on this account,\" Alexander tweeted. \"But without it, anyone can allege to be me. So, if I lose that \\u2714\\ufe0f know I will leave this platform. Anyone appearing with it=an imposter. I tell you this while I\\u2019m still official.\"\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nNumerous NFL players like Patrick Maholmes, Michael Thomas, and Darius Slay tweeted that they would not pay for the checkmark as well.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAs TechCrunch points out, Twitter initially rolled out the free verification service in 2009 after it was sued by former St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa after an account on the platform had impersonated him.However, Musk has displayed his disdain for the verification program ever since taking the company over. After losing half of Twitter's biggest advertisers when he acquired the platform, Musk rolled out the paid Twitter Blue subscription service. For just $8, anyone could be verified. However, that anyone included numerous accounts impersonating big brand names and companies. Soon after launch, Twitter had to pause the program due to these troll accounts.Twitter Blue was relaunched earlier this year, but it's not been very successful. Less than 500,000 users out of Twitter's 254 million daily active users pay for the service. Recent data on the program found that around half of all those paying were accounts with less than 1,000 followers. And recent screenshots indicate that Twitter is worried that the paid verification badge is becoming a mark of shame, as the company tests out options to allow paying users to hide it.",

            "description": "The universe is warped. And you can see it in a new cosmic photo captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful space observatory ever built. Astronomers pointed the giant instrument, which orbits 1 million miles from Earth, at a cluster of galaxies around 6.3 billion miles away.This cluster of galaxies, called SDSS J1226+2149, holds so much star and planetary weight that it's literally warping space, like a bowling ball sitting on a mattress. The warped cosmic area distorts and magnifies the objects in the distance. \"This effect, referred to by astronomers as gravitational lensing, occurs when a massive celestial object such as a galaxy cluster causes a sufficient curvature of spacetime for light to be visibly bent around it, as if by a gargantuan lens,\" writes the European Space Agency.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Webb telescope just found massive objects that shouldn't exist in deep space\\n            \\n\\n\\nIndeed, there is a giant cosmic lens between us and the objects behind SDSS J1226+2149. This natural lens, combined with the viewing power of the Webb telescope, allows astronomers to glimpse some of the earliest galaxies ever formed, born over 13 billion years ago when the universe was still young. In the image below, in the lower right area, you can see poignant examples of distorted light caused by warped spacetime. These are the red, elongated shapes. In particular, there's a red, \"long, bright, and distorted arc spreading out near the core,\" the space agency explains, an object dubbed \"the Cosmic Seahorse.\" Such powerful magnification allows scientists to peer into this galaxy and grasp the star formation inside this distant realm of space. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the bottom-right quadrant of this James Webb Space Telescope image, you can spy distorted galaxies caused by gravitational lensing.\\nCredit: ESA / Web // NASA / CSA / J. Rigby\\n\\n\\nThe Webb telescope, which hasn't yet operated for even a year, has years of unprecedented insights ahead. And it won't just be looking at profoundly distant galaxies.The Webb telescope's powerful abilitiesThe Webb telescope, a scientific collaboration between NASA, the ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency, is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal unprecedented insights about the early universe. But it's also peering at intriguing planets in our galaxy, and even the planets in our solar system.Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter today.Here's how Webb is achieving unparalleled things, and likely will for decades:Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. As described above, the telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.\"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrometers that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \\u2014 be it gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb will look at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find.\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\\xf3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.Already, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and the observatory has started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.

            "title": "Colossal space explosion is the most powerful humans have ever seen",
            "description": "Astronomers knew the space explosion last fall was huge.A blast mighty enough to overload many cosmic explosion detection instruments is certainly something our satellites and telescopes don't see every year. \"It's a very unique event,\" Yvette Cendes, an astronomer and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Mashable in October 2022. Now, with months of follow-up research, astronomers have concluded that such bright light (or radiation) from this gamma-ray burst \\u2014 the most powerful known type of explosion in the cosmos, and strong enough to create a black hole \\u2014 likely hasn't arrived at Earth in thousands of years.\"GRB 221009A was likely the brightest burst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur since human civilization began,\" Eric Burns, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University who worked on the new research, said in a NASA statement.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Huge, mysterious blast detected in deep space\\n            \\n\\n\\nIn the latest batch of research, published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, scientists scrutinized around 7,000 detected gamma-ray bursts to deduce the odds of seeing such a fantastically bright event. The answer: We'll likely only observe such a gamma-ray burst once in every 10,000 years.So this was extremely bright. Some dub GRB 221009A as the \"BOAT\" \\u2014 the \"brightest of all time.\" But, as with other distant space explosions, you need not worry. Yes, radiation from the blast passed through our solar system and allowed us to detect an event that happened 1.9 billion light-years away (meaning it took 1.9 billion years to arrive here). But this radiation has been spreading through space for eons, and it is so faint that sensitive instruments like NASA's Fermi\\xa0Gamma-ray Space Telescope are required to even pick up these signals. We're watching, but we're unaffected by the light.\"It's the equivalent of getting front row seats at a fireworks show,\" Cendes told Mashable last year.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nWhat caused this giant space explosion?The gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A trumped such previous explosions. Most instruments designed to detect this type of light couldn't handle the anomalously extreme radiation. \"The burst was so bright it effectively blinded most gamma-ray instruments in space, which means they could not directly record the real intensity of the emission,\" NASA explained. Fortunately, scientists used other data from the space agency's Fermi telescope to reconstruct the gamma-ray radiation. Here's how unusual the event was:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe unprecedented gamma-ray burst detection (on right) compared with the previous record holders.\\nCredit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center / Adam Goldstein (USRA)\\n\\n\\nWhat might cause such a giant blast? A giant star collapsing, and then likely exploding. An exploded star, after running out of fuel and collapsing on itself, is called a supernova. And for a star to go supernova, it must be quite massive \\u2014 at least eight times the size of the sun. But for a supernova to produce the strongest type of gamma-ray burst, the star must be 30 to 40 times the size of the sun. This recent powerful detection came from such a mighty star.And we saw it because a jet of light or radiation emitted from the blast happened to be directed toward Earth. That's part of why it appeared so bright. Scientists are certain that a collapsing star triggered the blast. But what happened next is still uncertain. Did the star collapse, explode, and then under such dramatic pressure, form a powerful black hole \\u2014 an object so dense and massive that not even light can escape its powerful grasp? The researchers watching this gamma-ray burst have not seen evidence of the star's explosion, yet. That means there's potential that the colossal star collapsed into a black hole, without a giant explosion. The rapidly forming black hole, too, would have ejected immense energy into space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA graphic showing the different types of radiation produced after a giant star collapses on itself, ultimately forming a black hole.\\nCredit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\\n\\n\\n\"We cannot say conclusively that there is a supernova, which is surprising given the burst\\u2019s brightness,\" Andrew Levan, a professor of astrophysics at Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, who researched the event, said in a statement. \"If it\\u2019s there, it\\u2019s very faint. We plan to keep looking,\" Levan explained, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s possible the entire star collapsed straight into the black hole instead of exploding.\"Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

            "title": "How do I break up with my toxic friend?",
            "description": "If a friend is causing more strife than joy, you're not alone: in a Bumble BFF survey from January, 32 percent of respondents said they're not satisfied with the friendships they have in their lives.Sometimes, we need to cut the cord in order to grow. We asked experts how to break off a toxic friendship \\u2014 kindly.Do I want to end a friendship?Know that conflict is a normal and healthy part of every friendship, said female friendship coach and Bumble BFF's friendship expert Danielle Bayard Jackson. While we might think of friendships as fun and easy, the reality is they're relationships that need maintenance.\\xa0\"That said, 'friendship pruning' is very common as many of us go through new stages of life,\" Jackson noted. And people are feeling that now: 25 percent of respondents in the Bumble BFF survey said they're stuck in outdated friendships that no longer serve them, while 68 percent said they're a different person now compared to the person they were when they met their best friends/closest friends.\\xa0\\n    'Friendship pruning' is very common as many of us go through new stages of life. \\n    \\n\"We can outgrow friendships and stay too long out of loyalty or history,\" said licensed psychotherapist and author of Boundary Boss, Terri Cole, \"but it is your job to be discerning about who gets the privilege of being in the VIP section of your amazing life.\"Only you can make the decision to end a friendship. Jackson laid out some questions to ask yourself when identifying a potentially friendship-ending conflict:\\xa0Is this a conflict that you are willing to compromise on?\\xa0Do these conflicts happen more often than not?\\xa0Do the conflicts become more hurtful over time?\\xa0\\n    It is your job to be discerning about who gets the privilege of being in the VIP section of your amazing life.\\n    \\n\"If the troubles of the friendship outweigh the overall value that it adds to your life,\" she added, \"it might be time to end that friendship.\"Cole also offered questions to ask about the friend themself:Can I trust them?Do I respect them?Do we bring out the best in each other?\\xa0Does this friendship energize or deplete me most of the time?\\xa0Do they care about and respect me?\\xa0\"If you can answer yes to the questions above and they energize you more than they deplete you, then the friendship is adding value to your life,\" Cole said. \"If you answered no to more than a few you might need to work on your communication and boundary setting.\"If you're in the latter camp, Cole recommends reflecting on how honest you are with your friend about your preferences, limits, and deal-breakers \\u2014 meaning, your boundaries. If you already set regular boundaries and your friend doesn't honor them, it's time to have a conversation to share your frustrations.\"If the person is toxic or the relationship regularly causes you anxiety, frustration and suffering \\u2014 it is time to cut them [loose],\" said Cole.\\xa0The word \"toxic\" is thrown around a lot these days, but it's true that some people just don't serve you. Signs of a toxicity could be feeling drained after spending time together, or feeling like you're not heard or can't be yourself around them, said relationship expert and certified sex therapist at SexualAlpha, Aliyah Moore.\\xa0There may be a slew of reasons why you don't want to break it off \\u2014 misplaced loyalty, fear of rejection, and guilt, to name a few. The truth is, though, staying in these relationships can build up resentment towards the other person, Cole said. You're also not being honest with yourself or your friend.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            TikTok is obsessed with the 'power struggle stage' of relationships. But what is it?\\n            \\n\\n\\nHow can I end a toxic friendship?Before committing to a script, Cole recommends energetically backing away from the friendship by not responding immediately and politely declining plans. The feeling of not vibing with the friendship anymore might be mutual! The mutual backing out of a friendship is what Jackson calls the \"friendship fade-out.\"It may be the case, though, that it's not mutual, and you have to have a conversation. Do so privately in a mode that fits for the friendship, whether it be FaceTime or face-to-face. Choose the right time and place, and avoid public situations where your friend may feel embarrassed, Cole said.\\xa0\\n    The mutual backing out of a friendship is what Jackson calls the \"friendship fade-out.\"\\n    \\nAcknowledge that it's okay to end a friendship, Moore said. \"You don\\u2019t have to feel guilty or bad about doing what is best for you.\"Jackson has a three-part conversation formula:1. Show your intention at the top of the conversation to set the tone and expectation. This can be like, \"So, I've been thinking a lot about this lately\\u2026\" or \"I have something on my mind that I would like to talk to you about\\u2026\"2. Address your needs and don\\u2019t play the blame game. Use \\u2018I\\u2019 statements as much as you can; rather than \"you are never there for me when I need you..,\" try saying \\u201cI need friendships in my life that can prioritize and support me in times of need.\"3. Tell them how much you appreciate them and what your intention is for moving forward. This could be, \"I have appreciated our friendship so much and you have been such an integral part of my life. However, I won\\u2019t be able to show up in this friendship in the same way that I have before.\"If your friend gets emotional, listen to them. While you can't control how they react, you can control how you express yourself. Be prepared for a range of possible emotions, Moore said, whether it be sadness, anger, or confusion. Try to remain calm and compassionate, even if the now-former friend isn't. \"Showing understanding and empathy will help to ensure that the relationship ends in a peaceful manner,\" she said.Be honest and respectful \\u2014 and don't ghost. As with most advice, however, there are caveats. If your friend threatened your safety and talking with them would make you feel unsafe, you can end the friendship abruptly and without explanation, Jackson said.\\xa0Take time to grieve the relationship as you would a romantic one. It's natural that emotions will come up, even if this is something you want to happen. Respect both your process and theirs; it's okay if it takes time, especially if you were friends for a long time.Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.What if we have mutual friends?If you have mutual friends, you may want to skip \"ending\" the friendship entirely and back away from the individual instead, said Cole.\\xa0\"Relationships morph and change so being unavailable for an individual relationship does not need to necessarily ruin the group experience,\" she said. If you \"cut off\" the individual completely, though, it will change the dynamic of the group.If you need to decline group invitations because you know that person will be there, do so, Jackson said. When you're ready to see them again, be cordial; you don't have to pretend to be excited to see them, but you don't have to make it awkward, either.\\xa0Don't put the burden of this on your other friends, Jackson continued. Try to refrain from gossiping or making them pick sides. This may be a good opportunity to branch out and make new friends, or reconnect with old ones not in the friend group.Through it all, take care of yourself, said Moore. If you've read this far, you likely want to be empathetic in this journey \\u2014 that's more than a lot of people can say when ending relationships. Be kind to yourself and give yourself grace, just as you would to this ex-friend or anyone else.\"Ending a friendship can be difficult,\" Moore acknowledged, \"but it is sometimes necessary for the sake of your mental health and wellbeing.\"",

You'll travel throughout the nine realms in search of a way to change the course of the Ragnarok prophecy, encountering various foes along the way who will stop at nothing to keep you from meddling with fate.

            "title": "The best carry-on luggage for every traveler",
            "description": "Whether you\\u2019re crossing state lines or international borders, having the best carry-on luggage can help you enjoy your trip fully. After all, no one wants to pay to check any more baggage than they have to. The trick is to find a carry-on that is big enough to carry your belongings, without being so big it won\\u2019t fit in the overhead compartment.While quality luggage can be expensive, a carry-on you can depend on is more than worth the investment. When comparing different carry-ons, consider not only size and maneuverability but other features like interior pockets and TSA-approved locks. Oh, and don\\u2019t forget to choose something attractive, too \\u2014 you want a bag that\\u2019s easy to spot, so you don\\u2019t lose it or get it accidentally mixed up with another traveler!What makes a carry-on bag?\\xa0Technically speaking, any bag that you \\u201ccarry on\\u201d to an airplane is considered a carry-on bag. Most airlines allow travelers to bring one piece of carry-on luggage or \\u201chand baggage\\u201d that can fit in the overhead bin onto a flight.What\\u2019s the maximum size for a carry-on bag?Each airline has its own restrictions for how large your carry-on luggage can be, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) doesn\\u2019t regulate a set size and weight either. This can make it confusing for travelers to know if their carry-on bag is \\u201clegal\\u201d or not. Most airlines allow carry-on luggage that according to the FAA must not be larger than 45 linear inches (length + width + height).\\xa0To avoid the hassle (and cost) of having to check your bag, make sure your carry-on doesn't exceed this size at full capacity, especially if it is an expandable model. No matter what, you should always check with your airline for their latest guidelines on carry-on size. How to measure carry-on luggageKnowing how airlines will measure your bag is key to ensuring a smooth trip. For starters, the airline will measure your luggage from the contact point with the ground to the highest point \\u2014 this means that both handles and wheels are included in the measurement.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best travel backpacks to keep you hands-free from point A to point B\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhat should I look for in a carry-on bag?\\xa0With so many carry-on bags available on the market, it can be hard to know what to look for to ensure you\\u2019re getting the best carry-on luggage. Here are some features that make packing and traveling a more pleasant experience.\\xa0Size Plus WeightArguably, the most important considerations when it comes to choosing the best carry-on luggage for your needs are size and weight. As discussed, you want a bag that meets the FAA guidelines of being less than 45 linear inches. But you also need a bag that\\u2019s large enough to hold all your gear for at least a couple of days. It\\u2019s a balancing act between the two sides.ExpandabilityCarry-on luggage that is expandable offers you just that little bit of extra storage capacity so nothing gets left behind. However, if you\\u2019re going to carry on your luggage in its expanded format, be sure to measure it to see if it meets airline specifications. The expandable feature is really ideal for when you\\u2019re using your carry-on as a weekend or overnight bag for non-air travel.\\xa0Spinner wheelsMost carry-on luggage comes with wheels, and in this case, more really is more. Bags with four wheels instead of two \\u2014 also called spinner luggage \\u2014 are easier to navigate in tight spaces because the wheels turn 360 degrees.Laundry bag/compartmentA carry-on bag that includes a laundry bag or compartment makes it easy to keep your clean and dirty (or wet and dry) clothes separated. Some bags also feature a dedicated shoe compartment, while others have a tri-fold garment bag to help keep your suit or fancy dress wrinkle-free.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The 10 best travel tech gadgets for your next adventure in 2022\\n            \\n\\n\\nTSA lockTSA officers must be able to inspect your baggage and its contents. Fortunately, there are carry-ons with locks that are TSA-approved \\u2014 which means they can be opened using a universal \"master\" key that only TSA agents have access to so that they don\\u2019t have to cut the locks off your bag.\\xa0What are the benefits of hardside and softside bags?The advantage of hardside luggage is pretty obvious \\u2014 it helps to keep the items inside the bag safe from damage. Hardside luggage is also able to withstand the elements a bit better than softside bags. The advantage of softside luggage is that it is a bit more forgiving in terms of being able to stuff more things inside \\u2014 and to stuff them in the overhead compartment. They\\u2019re also better for packing irregularly-shaped items.No matter what type of carry-on luggage you\\u2019re looking for, we\\u2019ve got an option for you. Check out our list of the best carry-on luggage below to find your next bag \\u2014 and bon voyage!",

Everyone had been more or less tolerant of all the time Shauna (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) was spending in the meat shed with Jackie's body until it was revealed she'd put makeup on her pal's cadaver. Finally, Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) insists that they burn their dearly departed team captain, despite no little protestation from Shauna and Lottie (Courtney Eaton), who defends Shauna's behavior as \"processing.\" The Yellowjackets set up a pyre and leave it burning overnight to cremate Jackie's body.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2: Let's unpack that Greek feast fantasy\\n            \\n\\n\\nBut this being Yellowjackets, nothing is ever so simple. A mysterious wind, perhaps courtesy of the strange forces of the wilderness, blows snow off a tree, covering Jackie and the pyre completely. The flames dim but don't go out entirely. Later, the Yellowjackets wake up to discover Jackie's roasted corpse, free of any snow and apparently smelling delicious. The rest is history.The Yellowjackets are starving by this point, so any food must seem divine to them. But is this potentially supernatural cooking job even possible, or remotely safe? The people must know! So we asked a James Beard award-winning chef who formerly ran a Michelin-starred restaurant to weigh in.For starters, the chef, who has asked to remain anonymous, pointed out that the \"cooking\" seen in the show did not correspond to any kind of meat cooking he was familiar with. He cited other methods for cooking whole animals, such as burying them in a pit, roasting them over a spit, smoking, or even grilling them. In those cases, though, the meat requires tending: You must monitor temperature and rotate or flip the meat to ensure that it gets cooked all the way through. In Yellowjackets, the force that is presumably the spirit of the wilderness forgoes any of those steps, simply chucking some snow on Jackie and calling it a day. The wilderness already has a lot on its plate; it takes a lot of energy to make Taissa sleepwalk, surely it can't be expected to do that and keep an eye on its meat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's going to take a lot more than some snow and embers to cook Jackie.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nBut even if the wilderness has some unconventional cooking methods, it's got to be on to something with that snow trick, right? Not according to our chef source.\"There's no purpose, scientifically, for snow covering the body itself,\" he wrote in an e-mail to Mashable. \"In fact, if anything, it'll serve to keep the body \\u2014 the top if nothing else \\u2014 from cooking to an appropriate temperature.\" He continued: \"The snow on the fire might be beneficial to temper excessive heat and prevent overcooking, but even that would be largely counterproductive if the body weren't fully contained in some closed unit to capture the gentle heat.\"Jackie's corpse certainly isn't left to cook in a closed unit, but it has been frozen in a meat shed for two months, so at least it hasn't rotted away. However, the most distressing part of the team's eating of Jackie \\u2014 apart from the actual cannibalism, of course, which will always take the cake \\u2014 is the lack of preparation of the meat. Unlike in the very first episode of Yellowjackets and the scenes with Pit Girl, we don't see the team bleed out or clean Jackie's carcass. (You know, because they weren't originally planning on eating her!) How does that affect the cooking of her corpse?\"When one roasts an entire pig, for example, it is gutted and prepped for roasting: The internal organs are removed and the carcass cleaned \\u2014 both for gustatory as well as sanitary purposes,\" the chef wrote. \"Cooked whole \\u2014 and especially fully frozen \\u2014 would expose anyone consuming that meat to excessive risk of food poisoning, as the blood-rich internal organs couldn't possibly reach the necessary internal temperature to render them safe, not specifically to eat but not contaminate the 'prime cuts.'\"In that case, the biggest enemy the Yellowjackets may face could be food poisoning, because the wilderness sure doesn't seem to care about proper food safety. For the sake of the show, I'm sure they'll be fine (you know, minus the trauma), but if you were considering trying this cooking method with non-human meat, just know it won't turn out well.\"Basically, without choosing to suspend our belief for the benefit of creativity, there's virtually not a snowball(-topped frozen corpse)'s chance in hell of being able to achieve this in reality \\u2014 especially overnight, if the thing's frozen solid,\" our chef source concluded. \"You ever considered cooking a fully frozen 20-25 pound turkey on Thanksgiving Day in a very low oven?\"Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

            "title": "'Yellowjackets' Season 2: Let's unpack that Greek feast fantasy",
            "description": "Cannibalism has been on the menu for Yellowjackets since its very first episode, but the show has always been fairly coy about how the cannibalism started \\u2014 and who was the first person to be eaten. Now, in Season 2's second episode, titled \"Edible Complex,\" we finally get answers to both those questions.In a move that shocks no one (but that we've all been dreading), the Yellowjackets' first taste of human flesh is none other than the frozen, two-month-old body of former team captain Jackie (Ella Purnell). The writing has been on the wall for Jackie's corpse since the Season 2 premiere, but the way in which Yellowjackets depicts the cannibalism is a bit more surprising. Instead of focusing solely on the Yellowjackets' flesh-tearing frenzy, the show cuts between the team's harsh winter reality and a Greek goddess-inspired fantasy \\u2014 a tactic that is stylistically and thematically intriguing, but that doesn't completely work in the broader context of Yellowjackets.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 review: Our favorite messed-up cannibals return \\u2014 with even more bite\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhy does Yellowjackets link cannibalism to a Greek feast?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Yellowjackets bid farewell to Jackie.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nThe Greek feast imagery functions as a major contrast to the Yellowjackets' lived experience. In the former, the team is dirty and clothed in makeshift winter wear. In the latter, they are pristinely groomed, with white robes and elaborate hairstyles that evoke wealth and divinity. The divine Yellowjackets behold a sumptuous feast of wine and delicacies, while their real-life counterparts devour the barbecued corpse of their late friend \\u2014 although the characters in both scenes relish their food with the same amounts of zeal.Despite the visual dissonance between the two feast scenes, Yellowjackets uses the Greek banquet as a thematic parallel to what the cannibalism will come to mean for the Yellowjackets. Cannibalism plays a major role in Greek mythology: the titan Kronos eats his children, and in two separate myths, the kings Tantalus and Lycaon try to trick the gods into eating human flesh, with disastrous consequences. (To further the Greek connection: Even the episode title, \"Edible Complex,\" plays on the Greek myth of Oedipus.)The Yellowjackets' feast itself recalls bacchanalia: frenzied celebrations of the Greek god Dionysus, or his Roman counterpart Bacchus. What starts as the Yellowjackets tentatively nibbling the fruits before them quickly descends into wine-splattered revelry. Throughout, they appear to experience the same bliss as those who worship Dionysus, himself the god of ecstasy.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Did you catch these 3 ties between 'Yellowjackets' and 'The Last of Us'?\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoomcoming.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nWomen who followed Dionysus were known as maenads, or \"raving women,\" and there is precedent for maenads tearing victims apart in much the same way the Yellowjackets fall upon Jackie's corpse. In the myth of Pentheus, depicted in The Bacchae by Greek playwright Euripides and the Metamorphoses of Roman poet Ovid, Dionysus leads his cousin Pentheus to the maenads. The maenads proceed to rend him limb from limb in an act of sparagmos, tearing a live victim apart, which in bacchanalia was often followed by the act of omophagia, the consumption of raw flesh. In some versions of the tale, the maenads in their madness believe Pentheus to be a wild animal, similarly to the Yellowjackets' drug-induced hallucinations in Season 1's \"Doomcoming\" episode that led them to think that Travis (Kevin Alves) was an animal and almost sacrifice him.So, Yellowjackets is drawing parallels between its characters and participants in ancient (and violent) Dionysian bacchanalia \\u2014 but why? These comparisons serve to complicate the Yellowjackets' cannibalism beyond a gross taboo, weaving it into a greater look at their belief system while stranded in the wilderness.As we know from the very first episode of Yellowjackets, the team develops a ritual around its cannibalism. They chase a victim into a pit, prepare the meat, and eat it around a fire alongside Antler Queen Lottie (Courtney Eaton). The imagery of the Greek feast in the team's very first moment of cannibalism sets this idea of ritual in motion, and adds a layer of religion to it. To the Yellowjackets, this act signals an escalation of their new wilderness-centric faith. After all, we've seen how Lottie wards the team for protection in the wilderness. Their bacchanal-inspired cannibalism may come to serve as an extreme way to appease the strange forces at work in the wild. It's not just a transgression of social norms: It's a show of faith.Does the Greek feast imagery actually work?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nThe references to Greek myth and ritual sacrifice come through loud and clear in this initial cannibalism sequence, yet they are at odds with the rest of the show.Yellowjackets traffics in departures from reality. Take Lottie's premonitions, Taissa's (Jasmin Savoy Brown) visions of the man with no eyes, and Jackie's pre-death fantasy of a happy reunion with her teammates. Importantly, all those departures are anchored in one character's point of view. For example, when adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) kills Adam (Peter Gadiot) in Season 1 and the show flashes between her and young Shauna (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) holding the murder weapon, we understand that this is adult Shauna recalling her past trauma and experiences with murder.Unlike these instances of departure, the Greek feast doesn't have a similar anchor. Could the fantasy be Shauna's way of processing her consumption of Jackie, or is it a shared team delusion? It doesn't feel like either. Instead, it reads more like the show omnisciently framing the cannibalism as a religious act. And that's where the scene falters: Prior fantasies and visions have all been explicitly character-driven. The bacchanalia floats in the ether as something the writers want us to know is important but doesn't tie to anything \\u2014 or anyone \\u2014 in particular.The Greek allusion is especially jarring given that the show steers clear of such explicit references, although as Sakhi Thirani writes for JStor Daily, the presence of Dionysus is felt throughout. Nowhere is this clearer than during their so-called Doomcoming, which sees the girls on the team dress up and hunt Travis in a fit of bacchanalian madness. Even then, the allusion isn't quite as glaringly obvious as it is in \"Edible Complex.\" This fantasy is entirely new to the show, and as such jars us out of a pivotal moment. Of course, there's a high likelihood that the jarring nature of the Greek feast is intentional. We're watching cannibalism unfold; this is no time to be comfortable! Yet I am rarely comfortable watching Yellowjackets anyway: The show does a wonderful job building suspense and creating squirm-worthy moments, all while keeping me immersed. The Greek fantasy being intercut with the actual scene of cannibalism broke that immersion and removed me entirely from the show. Yes, I found myself drawing connections to ancient Greek mythology and religion, but if that comes at the expense of the emotional intensity of Yellowjackets, can that really be a good thing?Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

            "description": "Since its start in 2015, the role-playing web series Critical Role has helped usher in a Dungeons & Dragons renaissance. Given the show's impact, as well as Critical Role's prior collaborations with Dungeons & Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast, it's only natural that it would get a shout-out in the new film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.The Critical Role reference is pretty subtle \\u2014 don't expect any cameos from Critical Role cast members or likenesses of their player characters from previous campaigns. Instead, this Easter egg comes in an early scene featuring sorcerer Simon (Justice Smith).Simon puts on a rather unfortunate magic show, where he's unable to conjure more than a few paltry sensory effects. One of these effects is the smell of fresh cut grass \\u2014 a spell that comes up later in the film as well. The wording here is very specific: not \"fresh grass,\" not \"cut grass,\" not just \"grass.\" No, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is adamant that this is fresh cut grass.So why am I getting so worked up about grass \\u2014 sorry, fresh cut grass? Well, it's because Fresh Cut Grass also happens to be the name of one of the characters in Critical Role's third Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Played by Sam Riegel, Fresh Cut Grass (or FCG for short) is an aeormaton, an ancient robot created by the people of the floating city Aeor. His distinctive name comes thanks to his former guardian, Dancer, who named her many robotic creations after her favorite smells. You've got FCG, Oatmeal, Apple Pie, and... others.When I first watched Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, I wondered if the repeated references to \"fresh cut grass\" were coincidences. \"It's a commonly enjoyed smell,\" I told myself. \"You're reading too much into it.\"But turns out, all the specificity about fresh cut grass is indeed a special treat for Critical Role fans! Riegel confirmed it himself in a Critical Role TikTok sponsored by Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.\"There may or may not be a reference in the movie to one of my characters from Critical Role,\" Riegel says in the TikTok, all while gesturing to his Fresh Cut Grass shirt. So there you have it! When it comes to fresh cut grass and Dungeons & Dragons, nothing is an accident.Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is now in theaters.",

            "description": "When Sam Norpel became ill with COVID in December 2021, she worked through the infection to meet a deadline. The former chief digital officer had a product to launch and no time to waste. Norpel met the deadline by working from bed, but her life became unrecognizable.A few months later, now debilitated and bedridden by long COVID, the 48-year-old mother of three and family breadwinner confronted an unfamiliar foe: suicidal thoughts. First, a malicious idea crossed her mind. Why hadn't COVID just killed her, she wondered, as financial concerns mounted and chronic pain persisted. That thought faded as her health improved. But months later, following worsened neurological symptoms that preceded a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, she experienced specific suicidal thoughts that felt far more insidious. \"It was that my whole identity was fractured,\" says Norpel. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            21 reasons to keep living when you feel suicidal\\n            \\n\\n\\nA loving text from her teenage son, sent unwittingly at precisely the right time, helped alleviate the intensity of Norpel's thoughts. So did an exchange with another long COVID survivor who reached out to her online, and who also felt suicidal. For the first time in a while, Norpel felt useful as she offered empathy. She had missed feeling like her life had meaning. Norpel's experience isn't anomalous. On Facebook, Twitter, and in other online groups and communities built by long COVID survivors, the topic often comes up, either in public conversations or direct messages. As pandemic emergency declarations expire, long COVID patients say it feels like they're being left behind, without the financial, medical, and mental health resources to navigate their chronic illness \\u2014 and the despair that can accompany it. But survivors interviewed by Mashable say that the empathetic connections found in their online communities offer a refuge from suicidal feelings, give them elusive hope, and help restore their sense of purpose.Long COVID, suicide, and online communitiesThough suicide is complex and caused by multiple factors, the possibility that long COVID increases risk is concerning given that an estimated 11 percent of the U.S. adult population currently has long COVID, broadly defined as signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after the initial phase of COVID infection. Serious illness, including chronic disease, is a risk factor for suicide. But so are other experiences that commonly occur in long COVID's wake, including unemployment, relationship troubles, financial strain, and social isolation. Some survivors lose health insurance, or never had it, and can't access mental or physical healthcare, which is another risk factor for suicide. Research also suggests that brain inflammation, which COVID can cause, may increase a person's risk for depression and suicidal thinking. Indeed, one preliminary study found that long COVID may be associated with suicide risk and concluded that \"psychiatric disorders and suicide risk should be systematically assessed in patients with long COVID.\"While there are long COVID patients who don't contemplate suicide, many with severe or debilitating long COVID describe how the illness suddenly destroys their carefully built lives. Some have no prior experience with mental illness, much less with suicidal thoughts, and feel afraid as they struggle to process these feelings. When they confide in each other, the effect can be lifesaving. The prominent suicide death of former television writer Heidi Ferrer, who had experienced long COVID, drew attention to the possibility of heightened risk when it became public in June 2021. In the public Survivor Corps Facebook group, where Ferrer was a member, people routinely respond with kindness and understanding to posters who, plagued by debilitating symptoms, feel they can't go on. Dozens of replies effectively say, in unison, \"We've been there, too \\u2014 just hold on.\" Some post contact information for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or other crisis lines. The group currently escalates explicitly suicidal posts to Facebook's moderation team, which reviews them and may reach out to the poster with resources. Survivor Corps founder Diana G\\xfcthe calls the group of nearly 200,000 people the \"epicenter of hope\" for long COVID patients. But as Survivor Corps, the nonprofit organization, winds down its official activities for lack of funding, it will also stop paying moderators to manage the Facebook group, leaving uncertainty about how it will continue given that each post is personally pre-approved.

Sign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletters today.A separate, much smaller and private Facebook group run on behalf of the federal Disaster Distress Helpline also offers a peer support community for long COVID patients, as do several other private Facebook groups. Many long COVID survivors find support groups like these by luck, either seeking them out online or by receiving treatment at long COVID clinics, which typically have lengthy waiting lists. The Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS) Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center effectively became a long COVID clinic during the pandemic and hosts several weekly video support groups. Current members live across the U.S., and receiving care at CIBS isn't a requirement to join, but the waitlist is currently 50 people long.\"When you look over the long COVID landscape it can feel very hopeless,\" says Dr. James C. Jackson, a neuropsychologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who runs the support groups and notes that members talk about positive developments like improved symptoms or becoming more resilient. \"So to be in a community with people where you're hearing stories of overcoming...it really adds a lot of hope.\" Finding support from other long COVID survivorsJackson says that in addition to chronic health issues, survivors grapple with day-to-day uncertainty about their well-being, livelihood, and future; medical professionals who may not believe, or cannot say, that there's anything wrong; social isolation because they're housebound or fear getting infected again; and, overall, a total dismantling of their identity. \"Part of the dynamic is life gets turned on its head pretty quickly for these folks and they don't know how to make sense of it,\" says Jackson, author of the forthcoming book Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving with Long Covid\\u2014A Practical Guide.Three of the CIBS support group's members interviewed by Mashable, who requested anonymity to protect their privacy, say participating is vital for their mental health. Marie, 57, lived with depression and anxiety that were treated with medication and therapy, but she never experienced suicidal thoughts prior to being hospitalized with COVID in March 2020. Among other medical conditions, she now has cognitive impairment, constant fatigue, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a blood circulation disorder that can cause lightheadedness, fainting, and rapid heartbeat. \"I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID,\" she says.\\n    \"I had a life that died, and I was like born again with this long COVID.\"\\n            - Marie, long COVID survivor\\n\\nWhile long COVID exacerbated Marie's depression and anxiety, the arrival of suicidal thoughts still came as a \"scary\" shock. But when she told the group she was spiraling, others provided a \"lifeline\" through their understanding and compassion, Marie says. When she came close to acting on her suicidal thoughts last fall, Marie sought Jackson's help and checked into a weeklong inpatient psychiatric program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a decision she describes as the \"hardest but best thing in my life.\"Suzanne, 46, says that every long COVID survivor should have access to a support group like the one offered through CIBS. Suzanne, whose husband of 20 years died of his COVID infection, experiences POTS, migraines, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and joint and muscle pain, among other health issues. For the past year and a half, she's brought her concerns to meetings and has never felt gaslit or dismissed. She also finds it rewarding to support others. Alex, a 23-year-old former competitive runner who surrendered his dreams of a career in the sport after contracting long COVID, experiences unpredictable flares in his symptoms, which also come with intense waves of depression, anxiety, and, sometimes, suicidal thinking. He says that the group rallies around members \"going through the ringer,\" which makes him feel less alone. \"This community kind of rises together to hold this person up when they can no longer hold themselves up,\" says Alex. Seeking solutions for long COVID and suicideFor Sam Norpel, the second bout of suicidal thoughts, about a year after her COVID infection, convinced her to share those feelings with her medical care team. She also told close family members how badly she was struggling, despite improvements to her physical health. Though she experiences speech issues, migraines, chronic fatigue and pain, and dysautonomia, a term used to describe problems with the body's autonomic nervous system, Norpel has joined the board of the nonprofit organization Pandemic Patients, in a limited capacity. She says this work, along with continuing to communicate online with other survivors, gives her a long-missing sense of purpose. Dr. Doreen Marshall, vice president of mission engagement for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, says that hearing survivors' stories is critical to understanding how best to support them. She emphasizes that experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time can be confusing and frightening. People may feel ashamed of having those thoughts. But she encourages survivors to think of suicidal feelings, which involve the brain, like any other health indicator that suggests something isn't functioning optimally, such as high blood pressure. While Marshall says there's not enough research to demonstrate a link between long COVID and heightened suicide risk, she says it's important that survivors do not suffer alone, and that employers and policymakers meaningfully address and support patients' mental health. Friends and family can also play a crucial role by checking in with loved ones who have long COVID, including asking if they're having thoughts about suicide if they notice talk of hopelessness, feeling like a burden, or sudden changes in mood or behavior. \"These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people...most people look at someone and do not realize they may be struggling with long COVID symptoms, and particularly mental health symptoms as a result,\" she says. \\n    \"These kinds of illnesses are often invisible to other people.\"\\n            - Dr. Doreen Marshall, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\\n\\nMarshall recommends that survivors experiencing intense suicidal thoughts contact a crisis line. While some survivors express skepticism about hotlines, partly fearing that those on the other end won't believe long COVID is real, Crisis Text Line and the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline told Mashable that their staff are ready to offer support. Crisis Text Line provides its volunteers with separate tip sheets about chronic pain and the long-lasting effects of COVID. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has resources related to COVID's impact on families, mental health, and managing relationships.Dr. Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist and an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine whose patients include those experiencing long COVID, says healthcare professionals should act with more sensitivity and compassion toward survivors. While mental healthcare can be very helpful for patients, Gold says physicians should resist the impulse to send them to a therapist solely because medical tests haven't pointed to a conclusive physical diagnosis. Gold says simply telling patients, \"I don't know what this is, but I believe you,\" would be far better than indicating that their physical symptoms are essentially \"all in their head.\" \"A lot of people turn to the internet and patient-supported communities because they want to know they're not alone,\" she says. \"They want to know that people see them and believe them. A lot of times that comes from peers, and doesn't come from medicine.\"At Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Jackson, who is also a research professor of medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, works with patients and support group members to identify what aspects of their condition they can live with, even if they'd rather not. Using treatment known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the aim is to lessen their emotional reactivity and find a way to \"co-exist\" with a certain level of discomfort or pain. Support group member Suzanne has found this strategy helpful: \"COVID and the devastation it leaves behind is definitely unmeasurable. But just trying to practice acceptance is not the same as giving up, or giving in, either.\"Jackson also teaches a strategy called \"unhooking\" wherein patients note thoughts that steal their focus and sap their hope, like the thought that things will never get better. Instead of becoming swept up in their implications, patients learn to simply observe them. And Jackson urges survivors to find and embrace the parts of themselves, from before the infection, that still exist. Marie knows she doesn't want to end her life, but the side of her brain \"that isn't quite working right\" can insist otherwise in her darkest moments, which is why support from other long COVID survivors has been so critical to her survival.\"You're just at the end of your rope,\" she says, \"and you need someone to help you at the end of that rope.\"If you're feeling suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody.

            "title": "There's a black hole pointed at Earth. You're not in danger.",
            "description": "You don't need to fear black holes. Over 100 million black holes likely wander our galaxy alone, and they are fascinating objects in the cosmos. They're unimaginably dense: If Earth was (hypothetically) crushed into a black hole, it would be under an inch across. This profound density gives black holes phenomenal gravitational power. But, fortunately, black holes aren't cosmic vacuum cleaners. They don't suck things in, though some objects can veer too close and fall inside, never to return.You might hear that certain black holes \"face Earth\" and shoot jets of energy our way, as scientists recently found in a galaxy over 650 million light-years away. This is true. There are countless black holes out there, and some are invariably positioned toward us. The most massive Earth-facing black holes, which can be billions of times more massive than the sun and dwell at the center of galaxies, are called \"blazars.\" They are powerful objects. Even so, these extremely distant objects aren't a threat. \"You're safe \\u2014 unbelievably safe,\" Douglas Gobeille, an astrophysicist and black hole researcher at the University of Rhode Island, told Mashable.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Black holes aren't evil cosmic vacuum cleaners, and other misconceptions\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn illustration of a powerful jet of energy shooting out from a black hole at the center of a galaxy.\\nCredit: NASA / JPL-Caltech\\n\\n\\n\\n    \"You're safe \\u2014 unbelievably safe.\"\\n    \\nHere's why blazars shoot energy into space, and why you're safe from these distant objects.Black holes shooting energy into spaceBlack holes are messy eaters. They don't swallow much matter that veers nearby. Most stuff gets shredded apart and spins rapidly around the black hole, forming a super-hot, donut-like \"accretion disk.\" As this cosmic dust and gas relentlessly spins around, it emits light and energy into space. Crucially, some black hole accretion disks also shoot two jets of energy into space. \"Oppositely directed jets of gas often form in the innermost zone of black hole accretion disks,\" NASA explains.The largest black holes \\u2014 and those emitting the most light into space \\u2014 live at the center of galaxies. And when one of these black holes happens to be oriented in such a way that a jet is emitting light toward Earth, it's called a blazar. \"It's more or less pointed straight at you \\u2014 it's dumb luck,\" Gobeille explained.Of course, many of the giant black holes at galactic centers, called \"active galactic nuclei,\" aren't pointed at us, so we see them from a different angle and can sometimes detect both jets shooting into space, as shown below. It's a bit like seeing different views of a peacock with its glorious tail open, explained Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\\u2013Milwaukee. If we could only see a peacock from the side, as opposed to the front, we'd notice far different details. Seeing a blazar is similar. \"It's basically the same thing seen from a different angle,\" Creighton told Mashable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe massive black hole at the center of the galaxy Centaurus A emitting great jets into space.\\nCredit: ESO / WFI (visible) // MPIfR / ESO / APEX / A.Weiss et al. (microwave) // NASA / CXC / CfA / R.Kraft et al. (X-ray)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bright object at the center of this image is galaxy PBC J2333.9-2343, with a blazar at its center.\\nCredit: Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii / Pan-STARRS\\n\\n\\nAstronomers observe many different black holes, from varying angles, to better grasp these mysterious objects in the cosmos. Our galaxy, too, has a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. But these objects, however powerful, are not a danger. Why black hole blazars are not a threatThe universe is teeming in light \\u2014 but much of it isn't the narrow band of light we can see. Many energetic events in deep space, such as star explosions, give off light in radio waves, which large radio telescopes regularly detect. Astronomers glimpse the far-off activity of black holes using radio wave observations, too, and this ancient light, or energy, is harmless. How harmless? \"These are very faint signals. The amount of energy collected in radio astronomy's history is less than the energy needed to melt a snowflake,\" Yvette Cendes, an astronomer and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Mashable earlier this year.\"They're lower energy,\" Gobeille emphasized.And, of course, black holes are great distances away from us. The galaxy PBC J2333.9-2343, which scientists recently reclassified as a blazar, is hundreds of millions of light-years away. If we squeezed the galaxy onto the University of Wisconsin\\u2013Milwaukee campus, relative to its size we'd be farther away than Caracas, Venezuela, in South America. \"There's absolutely no reason to worry about a black hole at that distance,\" Creighton said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn left, radio telescopes captured the jets emitted by the black hole (it's not a blazar) at the center of galaxy NGC 426.\\nCredit: NASA\\n\\n\\nWant more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter today.So, yes, black holes like one at the center of the galaxy PBC J2333.9-2343 are \"looking\" directly at us and emitting light into space. But this energy isn't nearly a threat. After all, the real threats are here on Earth, not out in the cosmos. \"People need to worry more about Earth, and never mind the things that are far away,\" Creighton said.",

These self-lit pixels are individually controlled by the TV itself based on the content and lighting of the room, offering more precise contrast than LED or QLED.More Sony TVs on sale Sony 55-inch X75K 4K TV \\u2014 $449.99 $549.99 (save $100)Sony 55-inch X80K 4K TV \\u2014 $649.99 $699.99 (save $50)Sony 55-inch A95K OLED TV \\u2014 $2,299.99 $2,799.99 (save $500) Sony 65-inch X75K 4K TV \\u2014 $579.99 $699.99 (save $120)Sony 65-inch X80K 4K TV \\u2014 $679.99 $849.99 (save $170)Sony 65-inch X90K 4K TV \\u2014 $999.99 $1,299.99 (save $300)Sony 65-inch A90J 4K TV \\u2014 $2,199.99 $2,699.99 (save $500)   Sony 65-inch A95K OLED TV \\u2014 $2,599.99 $3,199.99 (save $600) Sony 75-inch X80K 4K TV \\u2014 $899.99 $1,099.99 (save $200)Sony 75-inch A95K 4K TV \\u2014 $2,499.99 $3,199.99 (save $700) Sony 85-inch X80K 4K TV \\u2014 $1,399.99 $1,599.99 (save $200)Other TV deals from TCL, Vizio, and more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Opens in a new tab\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Insignia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Our pick: Insignia 65-inch F50 Series QLED Fire TV\\n            (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n$389.99 at Best Buy (save $260)\\n\\nGet Deal\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy we love itInsignia's QLEDs are a budget-friendly way into that vibrancy that LEDs with no quantum dots just can't provide.

            "description": "There's nothing like a feature-length chance to fall in love. And there's no better time to see it than right now. Whether you're preparing a cozy evening for two, having a long-distance hang with friends, or embarking on a private, solo cry over love lost/love won/the state of the planet/etc., romantic comedies are one of our greatest resources for emotional catharsis. Roll into the romance and humor of it all with abandon (and our help). Mashable has combed through every rom-com on Hulu \\u2014 no add-ons needed \\u2014 to assess the best of the best for your streaming buck. Here are the 10 best romantic comedies now on Hulu.1. Palm Springs \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Hulu\\n\\n\\nIn one of the best movies of 2020, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti play nihilistic wedding guests who become stuck in a time loop \\xe0 la Groundhog Day. Stupidly funny and surprisingly sweet, this sci-fi nightmare-meets-rom-com explores a been-there-done-that premise with a fresh approach and two leads you'll fall for instantly. (Fair warning: If you're in the middle of an existential crisis, maybe hold off on this one. Palm Springs isn't your average meet-cute.) \\u2014 Alison Foreman, Entertainment ReporterHow to watch: Palm Springs is streaming on Hulu.2. Brown Sugar\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: K C Bailey / Fox Searchlight / Kobal / Shutterstock\\n\\n\\nForget enemies to lovers, can you handle traveling the rocky road from friends to lovers? Rick Famuyiwa's 2002 rom-com follows a pair of childhood friends on their journey to grown-up lust and commitment. Their story begins on a street corner, where listening to hip hop spurred big career dreams for a boy and girl. Years later, Dre (Taye Diggs) is a successful record exec, while Syd (Sanaa Lathan) is a powerful magazine editor. But despite their natural chemistry, other could-be loves keep getting in the way. Can they get \"the best of both worlds...the buddy and the booty?\" Interweaving a passion for music with desire for each other, Brown Sugar lays down a sweet and smooth story you can't help but fall for. Nicole Ari Parker, Boris Kodjoe, and Queen Latifah co-star. \\u2014 Kristy Puchko, Film EditorHow to watch: Brown Sugar is streaming on Hulu.3. Fire Island \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Hulu\\n\\n\\nJane Austen's Pride and Prejudice gets a modern makeover with Fire Island. Joel Kim Booster reimagines the rom-com of manners as a gay love story set in the eponymous vacation spot. There, a chosen family of gay men and their lesbian den mother (Margaret Cho) revel with sunshine, champagne, and karaoke. But an unexpected buzzkill arrives in the form of a pretentious and posh lawyer (Conrad Ricamora), who seems to sneer at the group's idea of a good time. Despite an awkward introduction, the lawyer and the group's main character (Booster) kick off a promising romance. But can it be more than a summer fling? \\u2014 K.P.How to watch: Fire Island is streaming on Hulu.4. The Proposal Want a crackling tale of will-they-won't-they? Then say yes to this romantic comedy, which pairs Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. She's a hard-nosed Big City business woman; he's her harried assistant on the brink of breakdown. Think The Devil Wears Prada, but the boss lady needs a Green Card, and so the power dynamic shifts when the assistant takes her as his faux fianc\\xe9e to his hometown in Alaska. There, she'll have to play nice, even when faced with his eccentric grandmother (Betty White). Director Anne Fletcher fuses the sharp wit of her stars to an unapologetic silliness and vibrant warmth, making a movie of enemies to lovers an absolute hoot. \\u2014 K.P. How to watch: The Proposal is streaming on Hulu.5. Crush\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Hulu\\n\\n\\nThe most refreshing thing about Hulu\\u2019s latest queer rom-com is that all the characters are super queer. This isn\\u2019t a coming-out story about the one queer girl at her high school or the shy lesbian who\\u2019s secretly crushing on the cool, unattainable straight girl \\u2014 relatable, yes, but we\\u2019ve done it. Crush follows a playful (if predictable) love triangle in which very-out Paige (Rowan Blanchard) desperately tries to lock down her longtime crush Gabriella (Isabella Ferreira), the popular girl (guess what, she\\u2019s queer!), while drumming up a sweet connection with Gabi\\u2019s twin sister (Auli'i Cravalho), an introverted bi skater-girl type. The flirting is a little elementary at times, but the short-and-sweet Crush excels at showing young queer people being themselves and getting a sappy love story to call their own. \\u2014 Oliver Whitney, Freelance Contributor *How to watch: Crush is streaming on Hulu.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best short-ass movies on Hulu for when you need a short and epic watch\\n            \\n\\n\\n6. Ever After: A Cinderella StoryRom-com meets fairy tale fun in this 1998 jewel. A bubbly Drew Barrymore headlines this re-imagination of Cinderella, playing a spirited country girl in Renaissance-era France who is determined to find her own path to happily ever after. If her evil stepmother (a smirking Angelica Huston) has any say about it, her stepsisters will have all the world's advantages before the cinder girl gets a scrap of tenderness or fancy dress. But there's more to catching the eye of the handsome prince (Dougray Scott) than gowns and glass slippers. Hard stares, swordplay, a glamorous costume party, and a true love's kiss all dazzle in this one. \\u2014 K.P. How to watch: Ever After is streaming on Hulu.7. I'm Your Man\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Bleecker Street\\n\\n\\nWant an edge of sci-fi to your romance? Then you've got to watch this 2021 gem, which was German's entry for the Best International Feature Oscar. Maren Eggert stars as a scientist tasked with testing out a robot companion to see how convincingly human it might be. Tom (Dan Stevens) is handsome, attentive, and loves to dance. He's designed to say the right thing and anticipate every need. The idea is seductive, but this deeply rational (and a bit cynical) woman isn't so eager to fall for a robo-boy toy whose beating heart is an aim-to-please algorithm. Can real love bloom between (wo)man and machine? And what would that even mean!? Find out with I'm Your Man. \\u2014 K.P. How to watch: I'm Your Man is streaming on Hulu.8. Rye Lane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\\n\\n\\nAmong the most winsome movies of Sundance 2023 is this South London-set romantic comedy. Directed by Raine Allen Miller, Rye Lane stars David Jonsson (Industry) and Vivian Oparah (Class) as heartbroken twenty-somethings who fatefully cross paths and might just tumble into new love. A humbling beginning with a bathroom meet-not-so-cute swiftly spins into a happenstance first date full of fun, banter, surprises, and a wee bit of breaking and entering. (Hey, breakups get messy.) Painted in saturated colors, paced like a dance party, and brought to life by a kinetic ensemble cast, Rye Lane is a pure pleasure to watch.

            "title": "'Yellowjackets' episode 2, explained: The confusing hunger of teen friendships becomes literal",
            "description": "Who knew cannibalism could be so lavish?\\xa0We've all been waiting for the Yellowjackets to officially turn into flesh-eating comrades, after Season 1's many hints, and our remarkably concerning wishes come true in Season 2 episode 2, \"Edible Complex.\" We all saw it coming, but boy, did we not expect it to be quite like that.Played out as a lush bacchanalian banquet juxtaposed with the ruthless reality, the Yellowjackets munch their way through Jackie's (Ella Purnell) toasted corpse in a no-frills feast where no part of her is off the menu. However, their delightfully dreadful dinner hadn't actually been part of the plan; the team had been trying to cremate Jackie's body in order to let everyone \\u2014 but especially Shauna (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) \\u2014 move on. Instead, a pile of snow lands on Jackie's burning corpse, snuffing out the fire so her flesh is slow-roasted instead. Following their noses and their tummies, the team slowly shuffles towards Jackie's body with a salivating Shauna boldly declaring, \"She wants us to.\"\\xa0Now, we all know Shauna's been tempted to have a little bite for a while. Her small snack in Season 2's first episode did in fact scream, \"Hey! They're about to start eating each other!\" It all makes a lot of sense considering that they're starving, and Shauna's pregnancy means she's really eating for two. But with Shauna's incredibly questionable behavior since Jackie's death, is it possible that she always knew \\u2014 or even hoped \\u2014 the team was going to have to eat her at some point? Let's rewind.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust two bffs hanging out. \\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\\n\\n\\nAt the start of Season 2, we learned that it's been two months since Jackie's death. Instead of burying her or cremating her right after, the Yellowjackets decided to let Shauna mourn in her own special way \\u2014 keeping Jackie's corpse in the group's meat shed and letting Shauna spend hours on end with her in it everyday. Shauna's been imagining conversations with Jackie, posing her corpse, talking to it, and even playing dress up. While a part of Shauna's hallucinations is based on her perception of Jackie, another huge part of it is Shauna's internal psyche projecting onto her friend. We're really listening to Shauna's internal thoughts and conflicts in these conversations, and in episode 2, we start listening to the devil and angel on Shauna's shoulders speaking in real time.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 episode 1 features the single greatest Jeff moment so far\\n            \\n\\n\\nHer conversations with Jackie slowly start to get more twisted, with Jackie tempting Shauna to eat her. This imaginary Jackie is almost validating Shauna's darkest thoughts, reassuring her that she doesn't need her body anymore, the baby needs to eat, and that Travis (Kevin Alves) and Nat's (Sophie Thatcher) hunting endeavors are a moot point. But we're really listening to Shauna trying to justify her cravings in those moments, and imagining an impossible consent to cave into them. The temptation reaches a climax when Shauna accidentally peels off a layer from Jackie's skin, which almost undeniably suggests that a deeper part of her was ready to eat Jackie's body despite her surface-level reluctance \\u2014 which makes her reaction to Jackie's funeral all the more telling.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRIP Jackie, but not really. \\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\\n\\n\\nSimmering underneath Shauna's craving is a heavily alluded-to crush towards Jackie. You might not see it if you haven't experienced it, but Shauna and Jackie's relationship perfectly encapsulates the unique, complicated kind of queer awakening that can arise between same-sex best friends at that age. The entire experience is a mess of feelings, a constant see-saw between \"Wait, do I just really want to be like her?\" or \"Whoah, do I want to be with her?\" (Shauna sleeping with Jeff could be seen as another aspect of this push-pull desire.) Maybe by eating Jackie, Shauna thought she could hold on to a piece of her friend forever \\u2014 bones and all, as they say.When the Yellowjackets suggest burying Jackie, Shauna defensively rejects the idea saying the ground is too cold to dig through (something that was also eerily said by another onscreen cannibal we've seen this year). Was Shauna's reaction really out of not wanting to let go of Jackie yet, or was she scared that the team was about to waste her secret resource? Or was it actually both? Shauna's eulogy for Jackie begins \"I don't know where you end and I begin,\" which soon becomes literal in every way when Shauna consumes her, but it rings true emotionally; something heavily implies she's always seen herself and Jackie as one, infinite, non-negotiable vessel \\u2014 whether that's as friends, crushes, or meals. By eating Jackie, she's making sure that vessel stays afloat.Even if the Yellowjackets had decided to keep Jackie's body in the meat shed, Shauna surely was going to have another bite of her at some point. Based on her conversations with Jackie, the ear snack, the skin peeling, and all the subliminal love and desire brewing beneath the surface, eating Jackie was always going to be an end goal for Shauna, whether or not she would ever admit it. The group deciding to cremate her just expedited the process. And when Jackie's body accidentally cooks instead of chars, Shauna doesn't miss a single beat, taking it immediately as a sign to dig in.\\xa0Maybe the build-up to Jackie's devouring could have been a coincidental turn of events, but this is Yellowjackets, and it isn't too farfetched to believe that a part of Shauna always knew this was going to happen and was just waiting for the right time. The forest sending that gust of snow was all she needed to reaffirm her desire \\u2014 the final seal on a deal she's been trying to make for two months. And by the Yellowjackets' mutual willingness, it almost feels like eating Jackie was an unspoken agreement the team's had for a while, they were just waiting for Shauna's blessing \\u2014 and boy, did she give it to them.\\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

            "description": "The \"c\" in Yellowjackets officially stands for cannibal.\\xa0At long last, the team has finally had their first special meal, and it was equal parts \"what the hell is going on?\" and \"I can't believe this is finally happening.\" In their defense, the Yellowjackets did try to give their deceased teammate Jackie (Ella Purnell) a proper funeral by burning her body, since the ground was too cold and Shauna was spending way too much time in the meat shed with her dead bestie. It's not their fault snow somehow landed on the pyre and tenderly slow-roasted her instead. Right...? Right?\\xa0If there was anyone more bewildered than us in this week's episode, it was Coach Ben (Steven Krueger). Watching his face gradually go from shock and sadness to absolutely noping out in horror was tragically hilarious; he was the perfect mirror for the audience's reaction. While the Yellowjackets ripped through Jackie's body like a Golden Corral buffet \\u2014 which was portrayed onscreen primarily as a lush bacchanalian feast, both to lessen the gross-out factor and to connect it to the maenad imagery of \"Doomcoming\"  \\u2014 Coach Ben decided to sit this one out. He simply shut the cabin's door behind him, choosing to go hungry and hide from the grotesque sight. This group of voracious teen girls is quite possibly the scariest thing lurking in those wild woods.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRIP hanging out with the girls </3. \\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.\\n\\n\\nCoach Ben eventually might go cannibal if human meat is on a future menu, but for now he seems reluctant to partake \\u2014 and that might be a grave mistake. The Yellowjackets eating Jackie was the most critical group bonding they've done in the wilderness so far. It was a mutual turning point for all of them, where it became clear that no one was going to hold this taboo-breaking meal against each other because they're all on the same wavelength. It's trauma bonding at its absolute best, and Coach Ben refusing to take part positions him as a judgemental outsider.You're either part of the group or you aren't. And when the entire team is in on it except one person, well, that person's about to be ostracized in the worst way possible. The Yellowjackets might eventually gang up on their once-beloved coach, and if we can expect anything from their winter era, it's that he could be next. Even having one mouthful \\u2014 a finger or a toe, perhaps \\u2014 could save his life, in more ways than one.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' connects Seasons 1 and 2 with the movie 'Beaches'\\n            \\n\\n\\nGiven the Yellowjackets' writers expertise when it comes to foreshadowing, Coach Ben's reluctance could indicate that the team will either forcefully eat him next out of spite, or that he'll give up on trying to survive the harsh winter and sacrifice himself as a meal. In any case, if Coach Ben keeps up the moral superiority, he has a big bite coming for him.\\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

            "title": "'Yellowjackets': Is Jackie\u2019s necklace a clue to who dies next?",
            "description": "The Yellowjackets finally did the thing.\\xa0After Yellowjackets teased a descent into cannibalism for a whole season, the team finally sinks their teeth into Jackie (Ella Purnell) in Season 2 episode 2, aptly titled \"Edible Complex.\" The scene is as gruesomely chaotic as you'd hoped it be, with the girls succumbing to the smell of Jackie's roasting body in their own twisted version of a last supper. While Jackie's demise was heavily foreshadowed in Season 1's finale and even Season 2's first episode, attentive fans could have seen this coming from the show's pilot episode thanks to a neat little clue \\u2014 Jackie's necklace.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJackie's necklace was first seen on Pit Girl. \\nCredit: Screenshot Hulu/SHOWTIME. \\n\\n\\nThe show's very first episode begins with a grim scene that gave us a glimpse of what the team would turn into after months in the wilderness. A faceless brunette girl, unofficially dubbed \"Pit Girl\" by fans, is shown running \\u2014 or perhaps being chased \\u2014 through the snowy woods, before she falls to her death in a pit of wooden spikes. Her body gets dragged off by figures in uncanny costumes to what can only be described as a cult ritual led by the \"Antler Queen\" (whom we now presume to be Lottie (Courtney Eaton). While we don't yet know the identity of Pit Girl, the camera lingers long enough on her body to show she's wearing Jackie's necklace. Considering Jackie's munched-up fate, it's possible her necklace has taken on a whole new meaning.\\xa0We first realize the necklace is originally Jackie's when she lends it to Shauna (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) before their fateful flight takes off, as a good luck charm that'll protect her. Well, the team's plane crashed right after the exchange, so perhaps it's more of a hex than anything else. Plus, since Jackie was wearing the necklace when she died and we see Pit Girl later wearing that same necklace, it's entirely possible that it's become a symbol of something much more for the girls. The necklace could also a way to identify their next victim, not unlike the way cows are tagged before heading to slaughter. We're also seeing a new side to Lottie's spiritualism this season as she refines her different rituals and beliefs, as well as getting the others to join in. And if we understood anything from Lottie's cryptic French declaration in Season 1's finale \\u2014 \"Shed blood, my beautiful friends, and let the darkness set us free\" \\u2014\\xa0 it's that blood must be sacrificed for them to survive, and that everything the forest gives them must be returned to it in some way.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 opens with the perfect song\\n            \\n\\n\\nUnderstanding Lottie's belief system is important because while Jackie's body was burning, something in the forest dumped an avalanche of snow in just the right place to snuff out the pyre, slow-cooking Jackie's flesh instead. The smell of roasting meat and their starving bodies' response overrode any lingering disgust over this major taboo. The team takes this as a sign from the wilderness, justifying that it wants them to eat her, so using Jackie's necklace as a tag could be another aspect of the ritual Lottie cooks up (so to speak). Placing her necklace on each of their victims could also be an honorary tribute that's part of a larger sacrificial ritual. It's kind of like the May Queen's getup in Midsommar, a costume you traditionally wear for a rite of passage.\\xa0By marking each of their victims with Jackie's necklace, the Yellowjackets aren't just identifying who they're going to eat next; they're also simultaneously honoring the wilderness for showing them the way.While a lot is still unclear in the world of Yellowjackets, one thing's for sure: Whoever's caught wearing Jackie's necklace next should be worried.\\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays.

Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after?

But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it.

You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable.

            "description": "As someone who's currently playing a bard in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, one of the biggest questions I had while watching Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was \"Why isn't Edgin using any magic?\"With his lute and his smooth-talking ways, Edgin (Chris Pine) is the bard of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' adventuring party. By game standards, this means he's a full caster. Bards can cast iconic spells like Vicious Mockery, as well as magically inspire fellow players with Bardic Inspiration. But while Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves brings several classic game spells to life, such as Speak With Dead, it leaves many others \\u2014 including those associated with bards \\u2014 behind.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' review:\\xa0Does this fantasy adventure finally capture the magic of the game?\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe limited magic use also extends to druid Doric (Sophia Lillis), who frequently shapeshifts using Wild Shape but otherwise doesn't cast spells. Really, the main caster of the party is sorcerer Simon (Justice Smith), who has his own journey of self-discovery related to magic use.Given that Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves features several casting classes who never cast spells, I asked directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley how they chose which aspects of certain classes to bring to life in the film, especially when it came to magic.\"It was primarily dictated by the story,\" Goldstein said in a Zoom interview. \"Magic is so powerful and can solve so many problems that we decided we really wanted to limit it to certain characters, because then it forces them to find other ways through.\"Adding to that idea of problem-solving is the fact that Dungeons & Dragons spells aren't always a surefire way to get out of a jam. In the film, Simon complains about how everyone believes that magic is an easy fix to every solution. As the sorceror points out repeatedly (and as the film shows), magic has its limits.\"That's baked into Dungeons & Dragons, that limitation,\" added Goldstein. \"The game would be too easy if you could just cast a spell for everything.\"However, just because we don't see Edgin directly casting anything doesn't mean he doesn't have special abilities of his own. \"We also liked the idea that Edgin's only real magical power was being able to convince people to carry out his ridiculous plans,\" said Daley. \"And the fact that he's able to charm people and get people on board is a little bit less obvious of a power, but certainly something that makes him stand out in the group.\" Hey, that high Charisma modifier always comes in handy!Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is now in theaters.",

But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One of them has a twice-occurring letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?X.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?G, M, E, and H.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it. The answers are:GODLYMOTOREPOXYHEART",

            "description": "Twitter has just released \\u2013 as promised by owner Elon Musk \\u2013 the source code for its recommendation algorithm, and there's already been a very interesting discovery in the code.After pouring through the code, multiple people found at least one really interesting portion of the code that shows Twitter is specifically tracking metrics for users broken up into four different groups:\"power_user\"\"republican\"\"democrat\"and\"elon\"That's right, Twitter is specifically tracking how Musk's tweets are performing, and it's been coded right into Twitter's algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA screenshot of one of the relevant portions of the algorithm released by Twitter.\\nCredit: Mashable Screenshot\\n\\n\\nFollowing the release of the algorithm, a Twitter Spaces audio chat was set up by the company. Musk and a few of Twitter's developers took questions from listeners. A couple individuals brought this particular part of the algorithm up during the conversation.\"This is the first time I'm seeing this,\" Musk said when asked about the code that tracked accounts in these four groups including one just for his tweets. \"There\\u2019s a ton of stupid and embarrassing things being shown by making the code open source.\"While Musk claims he did not know about the metric tracking portion of the algorithm, he has previously admitted that Twitter was reviewing his account's analytics. He did so in a tweet last month in order to push back against reports that he called an emergency Twitter meeting to boost his tweets in the algorithm, after a Super Bowl tweet from President Joe Biden performed better than Musk's own tweet about the game.When a guest speaker on the Twitter Space shared his concerns about grouping accounts into the categories \"democrat\" and \"republican,\" one of Twitter's developers explained that this code was just for collecting stats. A note on the algorithm source code, however, states that the metric collecting was being used to ensure that changes to Twitter did not negatively affect any of these four groups.According to Twitter's own explanation of how this metric tracking is being used, if an algorithm change benefited an entire group of users, but negatively impacted the group made up solely of Elon Musk, it would not implement that algorithm change.Zo\\xeb Schiffer of Platformer reported that Twitter actually removed part of the source code that affected the reach of Musk's and other user's tweets before releasing the algorithm to the public.During the Spaces chat, Twitter explained that the metric tracking code was first developed into the algorithm years ago under the old Twitter regime. However, it was not explained why Musk's tweets were specifically being tracked, a part of the code that seemingly would've been added much more recently.\\xa0Musk did respond that Twitter would remove it.\"It shouldn\\u2019t be there,\" Musk said. \"Consider it gone.\"Musk also shared in a tweet following the Twitter Spaces chat that the company would make changes to the algorithm based on user feedback every one to two days.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nElon Musk did deliver what he said he would on Thursday. The owner of Twitter previously promised that the social media platform would be more transparent. Musk said Twitter would share its recommendations algorithm on March 31 at 3pm EST, and the company did just that.But, the release of this source code also comes days after Twitter forced Github to take down other parts of Twitter's source code that was allegedly posted by a former employee without the company's permission. So, clearly, there's still plenty of Twitter that Musk still doesn't want us to see.",

The vulnerability was discovered in January by cybersecurity research company Wiz and reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). In a Twitter thread, Wiz researcher Hillai Ben-Sasson explained how he was able to hack into Bing's content management system (CMS). By logging into Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure, he discovered that he could grant all users access to internal Microsoft apps. He then accessed a database of Bing's search results. From there, Ben-Sasson figured out that he could actually modify what showed up in the results. Wiz researchers also discovered that Bing was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack and discovered they had access to sensitive Office 365 data including Outlook emails, Calendar information, and Teams messages.

Will Jey Uso finally redeem himself, leave his toxic family and save his twin brother? Can Rey Mysterio knock some sense into his privileged and bratty son Dominik?

It is WWE's biggest, longest-running, and most successful pay-per-view/live-streaming event since its conception by executive chairman Vince McMahon in 1985. For many fans and wrestlers, however, it's basically the Superbowl. It's March Madness. The Masters, the NBA Championship, and the World Series. It's the be-all, end-all of professional wrestling. As such, WWE puts a lot of investment and spectacle into making each WrestleMania as memorable as the lastThe event takes place between mid-March and early April each year, with the company bringing together its best wrestlers (or superstars as the company refers to them as), legends, and celebrities in front of a massive audience of millions around the world watching at home or attending live.In an interview with Chuck Carroll of CBS ahead of WrestleMania 35, Becky Lynch explained what Mania and main eventing it meant to her:\"I have been obsessing about this. Not just this year but since I was 15 years old wanting to come into WrestleMania. So, it really is the culmination of my entire life\\u2019s work.\"Every year, WrestleMania's card gets bigger and bigger, and since 2020, the \"Showcase of the Immortals\" has become a two-night event. The same goes for this year's proceedings, with ESPN confirming on First Take the full lineup of each night's card.With 13 matches split between the two nights, below you'll see our best attempt at getting you emotionally invested in the marquee matchups that will dominate social media in the days to come. Or at least give you an idea of what's happening so you're not clueless in front of your wrestling friends:The story so far...Cody Rhodes vs Roman ReignsThe headliner of WrestleMania is the fated clash between two famous wrestling dynasties: The Anao'i family and the Rhodes. In the winner-takes-all championship main event for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship (the unified combination of the Universal Championship and WWE Championship), Roman Reigns will defend his title against Cody Rhodes.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIt would take an entirely separate article to fully explain the path each of these superstars took to reach this point but here's the long story short. For the past three years, Roman Reigns, known as \"The Tribal Chief,\" has held the Undisputed Universal Championship since August 2020. As the \"Head of the Table\" and the leader of his family, The Bloodline, Reigns is the company's longest-reigning champion since 1988. A member of the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty, Reigns is a first cousin once removed to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and fellow Bloodline members, twin brothers the Usos (Jimmy and Jey) and their younger brother Solo Sikoa.Reigns rules his family and WWE with an iron fist and, since the formation of the Bloodline, has spent the last two years emotionally and physically torturing his cousin Jey Uso through verbal abuse and a myriad of needless loyalty tests. Jey was Reigns' first challenger after the latter won the Universal Championship in August 2020, beating him unconscious in the match to the point Jey's brother, Jimmy, had to throw in the towel for him. Since then, Reigns has become a paranoid, loathsome villain unsure if he can trust his own family, incessantly seeking acknowledgment from any and everyone to mask his own insecurities.His challenger, \"The American Nightmare\" Cody Rhodes. The son of the dearly departed wrestling legend  \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes, Cody is one match away from achieving something no one in his family has done in WWE: winning the world championship. At once considered a WWE-lifer, Cody shocked the pro wrestling world and left WWE in 2016. From there, he traveled the world, wrestling everywhere from bingo halls to the Tokyo Dome in Japan. Making his mark in the greater world of wrestling outside WWE, Cody was instrumental in the creation of All Elite Wrestling, the biggest pro wrestling promotion to rival WWE since the shuttering of WCW in 2001. With AEW, Cody served as executive vice president and was one of the company's top stars. Cody then shocked the world again by leaving AEW to return to where it all started\\u2014back to WWE. The winner of the annual Royal Rumble match (a 30-man battle royale where the winner receives a WrestleMania main event), Cody has the opportunity to do something no one in WWE has not been able to do in three years: beat Roman Reigns. Having not suffered a 1-v-1 loss since 2020, The Tribal Chief could be an insurmountable challenge for Cody at WrestleMania. However, thanks to growing resentment within the Bloodline, the thing that could stop Roman Reigns might be his own family.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nThe betrayal and redemption of Sami ZaynAn integral component of the brewing collapse within the Bloodline is that of Canadian wrestler Sami Zayn, who, along with fellow Canadian and friend Kevin Owens, is set to take on the Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nSince this time last year, Zayn has been an unofficial member of the Bloodline, forming an alliance with the Tribal Chief when the former was seeking help during a feud with Drew McIntyre. Before long \\u2014 and much to Jey\\u2019s chagrin \\u2014 Sami Zayn seemed to make his way into Roman Reigns\\u2019 inner circle. In November, after much tension, Zayn finally proved himself a member of the Bloodline by low blowing his friend Kevin Owens (yes the guy he's teaming up with Saturday. Their history together is also a long story for another time). Even after this, Reigns, a paranoid narcissist, called into question Zayn's loyalty. This time he was saved by Jey who had finally come to accept him into the family.\\n\\n\\nThat little heartfelt moment didn't last for long. At the Royal Rumble, after successfully defending his title against Owens, Reigns tasked Zayn with once again harming his best friend. But this time, Zayn did something not even Jey could do in the past few years\\u2014Sami fought back. In genuinely one of the best moments in recent WWE memory, Zayn finally fought back against the abuse laid out to him by Reigns and took a steel chair to Tribal Chief to save his best friend. The event has started a road to redemption for the once delusional sycophant and set the stage for not only the tag team championship but the main event as well. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nBianca Belair and the women of WWE continue to make historyWrestleMania is all about full circle moments and nothing feels more full circle than both Women's Championship matches. The first is Bianca Belair's championship defense of her Raw Women's title against Asuka. Belair, the longest reigning Black world champion in the company's history and one-half of the first-ever WrestleMania main event to feature two black women, is set to defend a title she won last year at...WrestleMania. A former collegiate track athlete with no background in pro wrestling, Belair has made her mark as one of WWE's top stars, breaking down doors and barriers in the sport that was once inaccessible to women and Black wrestlers.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nCalled the \"EST of WWE\" (because she's the fastEST and strongEST), Belair is set to defend against the world-weary veteran Asuka, who's become a staple of WWE programming in the last half-decade. Asuka made her name known working in Japan and has won every accomplishment possible in WWE. Just like Belair, Asuka is a pioneer for women's wrestling in WWE and their clash at WrestleMania is sure to steal the show.Another full-circle moment in the women's division sees Rhea Ripley challenge Charlottle Flair for the Smackdown's Women's Championship. Three years ago, Flair won the Women's Royal Rumble and challenged Ripley for the NXT Women's Championship. Ripley lost to Flair on that night and has never beaten her since.Now, the roles are reversed with Ripley having won the Women's Royal Rumble and challenging Flair for her title at this year's WrestleMania. Ripley has taken on a meaner, darker persona since then having joined the Judgement Day, a faction of wrestlers best described as goth bullies.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nA rematch three years in the making, Ripley vs Flair is the likely main event for night one.Another marquee matchup on night one is a six-women tag team match featuring wrestling legends Trish Stratus and Lita. Joined by Becky Lynch, the winner of the first-ever women's WrestleMania main event, the three women will face Damage CTRL (Bayley, IO SKY, Dakota Kai). The story at play is that Damage CTRL has been disrespecting the good names of these iconic WWE legends.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nStratus and Lita have done a lot of work to lay the foundation of the women's revolution and it's a treat for fans to see the two perform at WrestleMania once again since the two retired as full-timers years ago.Best of the rest of the cardThat just about covers the bigger storylines going into WrestleMania 39, but what about the matches on the card? While not the A stories featured on this year's Showcase of the Immortals, there are plenty of fights that might be of interest to keep you invested through the night's events.The first is a pair of matches featuring members of the aforementioned faction of goth bullies, The Judgement Day. Dominik Mysterio, the son of the iconic luchador Rey Mysterio, is set to face his father after months of goading and disrespect by the former. Rey has finally had enough of his son's antics which include many, many ruined holiday dinners and even a night in jail. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nThe second Judgment Day match is between the faction's leader Finn Balor and former leader Edge. Set inside Hell in a Cell (basically a giant steel cage), this is the end of a vicious rivalry that saw Balor and Judgement Day put Edge's wife in the hospital. If you've ever felt the shame and humiliation of being kicked out of the spooky, supernatural friend group that you started, then you can understand why Edge is upset. Especially after said friend group of goth bullies spend months harassing you and your family.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIf you're a fan of genetic freaks of nature doing things no one that size should be doing, you'll enjoy  Brock Lesnar vs Omos and the WWE Intercontinental Championship match between Gunther, Sheamus, and Drew McIntyre. What's the story here? I don't know, beats me. Then what's there to enjoy? Big meaty men slapping meat. Sometimes in wrestling, it's best to just turn your brain off. Lesnar, a former UFC Heavyweight champion, will chow down with our 7'3 Nigerian overlord Omos. It'll be a spectacle for everyone's collective monkey brains.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nThe story of the Intercontinental Championship match is quite literally built on how much these three men have beaten the shit out of each other in past matches. No seriously, take a look at this match between Gunther and Sheamus back in September:\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nIf you're a fan of celebrities that have no business being in a wrestling ring, then you'll love Logan Paul vs \"The Visionary\" Seth Rollins. Paul has made a couple of WWE appearances which included a world championship match against Reigns in Saudi Arabia (I promise that's a real thing that happened). To the surprise of many, Paul has taken quickly to the ring thanks to his impressive athleticism and his work as a social media influencer making him a natural entertainer in a business that calls itself \"sports entertainment.\" It also helps that he seems to genuinely appreciate and respect the craft and dedication it takes to be a wrestler full-time.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nWWE is no stranger to having celebrity matches at WrestleMania. Infamously, former-NFL star Lawrence Taylor wrestled in the main event of WrestleMania 11, Floyd Mayweather had a boxing match against the Big Show at WrestleMania 24, and most recently Bad Bunny appeared in a tag team match at WrestleMania 37. This is the match most non-wrestling fans may tune in to see as Paul steps into his second WrestleMania match to date.Hosted by WWE superstar and NBA celebrity all-star standout Mike \"The Miz\" Mizanin, celebrities from all across the entertainment world will be set to make WrestleMania appearances like Snoop Dogg, Becky G, and Jimmie Allen. Those are just the ones that have been announced but WrestleMania is built on surprise so one should be on the lookout for more.Speaking of celebrity wrestlers in Hollywood, John Cena, a 16-time world champion and star of HBO's Peacemaker, is set for a WWE United States Championship match against Austin Theory. Cena is slowly ramping down his pro wrestling career as he settles into his acting career ala Dwayne Johnson and Dave Bautista. Coincidentally enough, the last time WWE held WrestleMania in Hollywood in 2005, it was Cena who starred in the main event, winning his first WWE Championship.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nNow, 18 years later, Cena will be the opener facing off against a new generation of stars who are making their mark in the wild, wacky world of WWE.The intertwined storylines both scripted and organic have created a card of matches full of irony and full circles With an estimated 65,000 fans set to attend both nights of WrestleMania, the WWE Universe is set to watch one of the best pro wrestling events in the world. If you're not a fan but have read this far, I hope you stick around and watch a match or two this weekend. Cause when wrestling is at its best, it really is the best entertainment around. And even when's it not, at least you can find enjoyment in the cringe.",

            "description": "Google's newly-released chatbot, Bard, lacks pizazz, to say the least. The company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, addressed these concerns on the New York Times' Hard Fork podcast Thursday. While acknowledging that Bard has its weaknesses, Pichai claimed that an injection of raw power was imminent.In Mashable's own tests of Bard, the chatbot's answers could indeed be a letdown \\u2014 bland and terse when what we were specifically asking for was something spicy and creative. However, in some areas we appreciated its no-nonsense explanations, and we even noticed the potential for something great in its direct-but-counterintuitive answers to tough questions.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            ChatGPT banned in Italy\\n            \\n\\n\\nPichai explained on Hard Fork, \"We knew when we were putting Bard out we wanted to be careful. It\\u2019s the beginning of a journey for us. [\\u2026] Since this was the first time we were putting out, we wanted to see what type of queries we would get. We obviously positioned it carefully.\"And in fairness, the word \"Bard\" in the logo on the Bard homepage is followed immediately by the word \"experiment.\" The blog post announcing Bard called it, \"an early experiment that lets you collaborate with generative AI.\" Yet, the public didn't dial its expectations to exactly the level Pichai intended, he explained.  \"We tried to prime users to its creative collaborative queries,\" he said, \"but people do a variety of things. I think it was slightly maybe lost. [\\u2026] So in some ways, we put out one of our smaller models out there, what\\u2019s powering Bard. And we were careful.\"Pichai likened Bard to a \"souped-up Civic\" in a race against hotter sports cars. That's an odd appeal to Google's humility that may not win your sympathies if you consider that Google has been accused by the Justice Department of monopolistic business practices, and that its parent company Alphabet is one of Fortune Magazine's top 10 most powerful companies in the world. In any case, here's the good news for all Bard fans out there: Pichai says the chatbot is about to get upgraded to a new model soon, like, really really soon. \"We clearly have more capable models. Pretty soon, maybe as this goes live, we will be upgrading Bard to some of our more capable PaLM models, so which will bring more capabilities, be it in reasoning, coding. It can answer math questions better. So you will see progress over the course of next week.\"Naturally, Pichai hedged a bit, explaining that safety and user experience are of paramount concern. \"We are all in very, very early stages. We will have even more capable models to plug in over time. But I don\\u2019t want it to be just who\\u2019s there first, but getting it right is very important to us.\" Translation: Don't expect the upgrade to burst onto the metaphorical court and dunk on the current metaphorical Lebron James of large language models: GPT-4.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nGoogle's attempts to keep expectations low in this area are probably wise, given the recent accusations that the company is training its models on outputs from ChatGPT \\u2014 which Google denies. Training a large language model on outputs from someone else's large language model is a little like photocopying a map and calling yourself a cartographer \\u2014 not a good look.Pichai also hinted at a not-too-distant future where powerful, personalized models exist for every user. \"In some ways, [a personalized model] is what we envisioned when we were building Google Assistant. But we have the technology to actually do those things now.\" So keeping in mind that Bard is owned by the company that owns or develops the products billions of people use to organize their lives, it's probably not wise count out Google as an eventual heavy-hitter in the chatbot world.",

You can't go wrong with an iPad in any of its various configurations. In fact, we've named the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and original iPad lines some of the best tablets on the market, and fantastic options for all budgets. Though the iPad Mini didn't make the cut, it's still very much worth buying, especially when you can get it at a discount. Right now, the 2021 64GB Wi-Fi Apple iPad Mini (6th generation) is on sale at Amazon for just $399.99. That's 20% off its normal price of $499, and a savings of $99. You can choose between Space Gray and Starlight, though if you don't like either of those hues, an iPad case can cover things up quite nicely. The diminutive version of Apple's tablet lineup boasts several upgrades over its previous iteration. Not to mention, its small form factor is attractive for those with smaller hands. It comes packing a larger 8.3-inch display, the addition of a Touch ID panel, stereo speakers, and better cameras. It also has second-generation Apple Pencil support. It might not be the complete powerhouse that an iPad Pro is, but it certainly fits the bill for most things you might want to do on the go. ",

            "description": "As the country honors Transgender Day of Visibility \\u2013 and legislators simultaneously debate access to life-saving treatments \\u2014 TikTokkers have put their money where their mouths are, raising more than $1 million for trans healthcare services in less than six hours. The donations came through a social media livestream takeover by Mercury Stardust, also known as TikTok's \"Trans Handy Ma'am\", and creator and advocate Jory (known as @AlluringSkull). This is the second annual \"TikTok-A-Thon for Trans Healthcare\" led by Stardust, who raised $120,000 last year in a 24-hour livestream. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Emira D'Spain's rose-colored glasses are both a fashion accessory and a way of life\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhat was initiated as an elongated 30-hour livestream running Thursday through Friday night and once again benefiting nonprofit Point of Pride \\u2014 an organization created by former trans apparel brand Point 5cc to fund gender-affirming clothes, treatments, and surgeries for trans folks around the country \\u2014 turned into an astonishingly speedy, mutual aid fundraising project. The livestream hosts, accompanied by Point of Pride president and co-founder Aydian Dowling, had met their first $250,000 goal before the event even kicked off. \"We raised 50k in one hour during a test stream last night! This money will provide help to 11k Trans ppl who can't access it otherwise! Thank you to everyone who has supported this already,\" Stardust wrote in an Instagram post days prior to the livestream.By 10:30 p.m. Thursday, the fundraiser had collected $930,000. In the five minutes it took the group to spot a spider floating in frame and concoct a plan to move it outside, the fundraiser has gained another $5,000.  According to the fundraiser's Point of Pride donation page, proceeds will go to the organization's Gender Affirming Care Access fund, part of a series of scholarship and grant-giving opportunities hosted by Point of Pride to provide Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and other gender-affirming surgeries and treatments. The TikTok funds will provide one year of free HRT access for at least 100 applicants and additional services for another 250 recipients. Additional funds will support donations of chest binders and femme shapewear to more than 3,000 recipients, with the potential to help 11,000 trans people. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nUpon hitting the $1 million mark, under a shower of confetti, Dowling popped in frame to make a statement. \"The amount of beauty and joy that this is going to bring... This couldn't have come at a better time.\"\"If you take away our healthcare, we will find a way to support each other,\" Stardust told the livestream viewers. \"Like we always have. Mutual aid at its finest.\"The TikTok-A-Thon, which has increased its goal to $2 million, will run until 11 p.m. EST on March 31. Tune in on TikTok or Instagram, or text \"STARDUST\" to 44-321 for more information. \\nUPDATE: Apr. 1, 2023, 9:28 a.m. EDT The TikTok-A-Thon surpassed its $2 million goal, raising more than $2.2 million in total, including meeting a $200,000 \"stretch goal\" to support gender-affirming surgeries for the hosts and Point of Pride staffing and infrastructure support, with all other proceeds funding Point of Pride programs and services, according to the donation page as of Saturday morning. \\n",

            "description": "The Night Agent has one job. It's literally written on the tin. But the titular protagonist of Netflix's latest action series refuses to keep work-life balance a priority, spending most of the series working in the day. And I'm concerned for him.I'll admit it, there's plenty more about The Night Agent series to focus on: There's a mole in the White House? Who set up the Night Agent as a deep state accomplice and ruined his reputation? Who are all these shady characters, and why do they want a former tech CEO dead? But it's the principle of the thing: The Night Agent working during the day is all the evidence we need that capitalism is well and truly fucked. Call this professionally vampiric man's manager. The Night Agent needs time to sleep, regardless of how work-life balance looks at the White House.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Insomnia Twitter is a remarkably unhinged yet unifying place\\n            \\n\\n\\nBased on Matthew Quirk's novel and created by Shawn Ryan, The Night Agent follows low-level FBI agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) who works in a windowless room in the basement of the White House. He's part of what's known as the \"Night Action\" team, which always makes me point finger guns at the screen whenever it's named aloud. Under the command of White House chief of staff Diane Farr (Hong Chau), Peter sits around processing paperwork and waiting for hotshot Night Agents to call the secret landline if they're in need of assistance \\u2014 something he fails at the first time we see the phone ring. Three rings, Peter? You picked it up after three rings? Sir, this is the FBI. One ring.On the end of this call is cybersecurity entrepreneur and ex-CEO Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), whose connection to two Night Agents drags Peter out of the basement and into the field. Now he's a Night Agent! And he can kiss his sleeping hours and the title of the show goodbye, as he'll be required to be a Dayman ah-ah-ahhhhh! too. Which is great, but not \\U0001f44f what \\U0001f44f we \\U0001f44f are \\U0001f44f here \\U0001f44f for. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis man has been awake for multiple days at this point, still working.\\nCredit: Dan Power/Netflix\\n\\n\\nDoes the Night Agent ever sleep?Friends, I'm concerned for the wellbeing of our eponymous hero. FBI agents need sleep like the rest of us. Dana Scully and Fox Mulder snoozed in The X-Files. Clarice Starling napped in Silence of the Lambs. Dale Cooper loved a post-memo kip in Twin Peaks. The Night Agent sees Peter staying awake for his job over several nights, keeping watch over Rose in his apartment, outside her family's cabin, just everywhere. Peter insists on staying awake; he's used to the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift after all. But the thing is, Peter always seems to do something in the day after his night shifts, which means he goes straight from an eight-hour shift to a full-on pursuit by assailants, without so much as a nap. Peter does accidentally take one nap, on the White House chief of staff's couch but it's unclear how long he's been lying there. This man needs a good night's sleep! The Night Agent is now streaming on Netflix, all day and all night. ",

Everything Everywhere All at Once\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMichelle Yeoh is up for Best Lead Actress at this year's Oscars.\\nCredit: A24\\n\\n\\nOne of the absolute best movies that 2022 had to offer, Everything Everywhere All at Once boasts a little bit of everything, from a deeply poignant mother-daughter tale to a gleefully silly thread involving a quirky one-hit wonder, to a romantic scene featuring hot dog fingers and a sprawling battle involving butt plugs. It's A24's highest-grossing film to date and it swept the Oscars this year, taking home Best Picture, Best Director, and all four acting awards.Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (aka Daniels), Everything Everywhere All at Once stars Michelle Yeoh in her most exhilarating role yet: a multiverse-hopping mom, dedicated to saving all existence but especially her on-the-edge daughter (the sensational Stephanie Hsu). Having more fun with the multiverse concept than Marvel could dare, this outrageous action-comedy giddily thrusts audiences into wild alternative worlds, brandishing unexpected weapons alongside jaw-dropping fashion and wildly captivating performances from Yeoh, Hsu, and their totally game co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis.* \\u2014 Kristy Puchko, Film EditorWhat we thought: Everything Everywhere All at Once is a tornado of a movie: dizzying, filled with turns, and peppered with eye-catching elements.

Everything is on the table this season. \\u2014 S.C.What we thought: Jesse Armstrong's Emmy-winning drama takes no prisoners in its fourth and final season. It's as unsparing and sharp as its predecessors, yet somehow manages to up the show's audacity to new heights. \\u2014 B.E.How to watch: Succession Season 4, episode 1 is streaming now on HBO Max, with new episodes airing weekly on Sundays at 9 p.m.7.

In John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, our hero is deemed \"excommunicado\" for an unauthorised killing of a High Table crime lord. So, he calls in a favour from an old friend and assassin, Sofia Al-Azwar (Halle Berry). There's plenty of animal involvement here, especially from Sofia's highly skilled dogs.How to watch: John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is now streaming on Peacock Premium.8.

McLaughlin broke the story with fellow journalist Jean Cole, played by Carrie Coon. \\u2014 S.C.What we thought: Ruskin's execution of his \"inspired by true events\" narrative seems less like a feminist historical thriller in the vein of Hidden Figures or She Said, and more a clumsy and ghoulish imitation of David Fincher's seminal Zodiac. The resulting film is a crime against cinema on several counts. \\u2014 K.P.How to watch: Boston Stranger is now streaming on Hulu.9. The Last of Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis sequence tho \\U0001f62d\\nCredit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\\n\\n\\nIt's been the one to beat and no one has until this week. The Last of Us was the most streamed of the week for nine weeks running, right up until the finale. Chernobyl director Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann bring the lauded Naughty Dog survival adventure game to the screen, with a deeply moving, stunt-packed, superbly scripted, and powerfully performed television show. Pedro Pascal takes the lead as Joel Miller, a man living in a post-apocalyptic America in 2023 amidst a pandemic caused by the Cordyceps fungus, which turns regular humans into monsters. He's tasked with bringing 14-year-old Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, across the country on a mission, but there's more than monsters that stand between them and their destination. Fans will be especially thrilled to see how HBO's The Last of Us masterfully weaves in the game mechanics, but they'll have to keep on their toes for new inclusions, clues, and breadcrumbs. \\u2014 S.C.What we thought: Making a TV show that lives up to the source material is always a high bar to clear, but especially so in this case. Luckily for gamers and new viewers alike, The Last of Us leaps over it with room to spare, chasing excellence with the boundless energy of a Clicker hunting its prey. \\u2014 B.E.How to watch: The Last of Us airs at 9 p.m. ET every Sunday on HBO and HBO Max.10.

            "title": "How to spice up your sex life when you have endometriosis",
            "description": "Sex, for many of us with chronic pain conditions and disabilities, is not a straight-forward thing. Issues such as dyspareunia (the medical term for painful penetration), low libido, discomfort, irregular bleeding are all potential reasons for this, and all of which can be caused by the same culprit \\u2014 endometriosis.Endometriosis is a condition which causes cells similar to the ones in the lining of the uterus to grow elsewhere in the body and is estimated to impact one in ten people assigned female at birth. These cells react in the same way as those within the uterus, building up throughout the month and eventually breaking down as blood. However, unlike the cells within the uterus that leave the body as a period, this bleeding has no way of escaping, therefore causing a variety of issues ranging from chronic pain, fatigue, and depression, to fertility issues, wider social complications (such as one\\u2019s ability to fulfil work, social commitments, and relationship needs) and, in some cases, organ damage.\\xa058 percent of people with endometriosis feel that it has impacted their sex drive, and 54 percent believed that this had damaged their relationships with sexual partners, according to LoveHoney data shared with Mashable. Of the 38 percent of people surveyed who had not not spoken to a doctor about this, 30 percent shared that they did not know who to speak to, or could not bring themselves to talk about it. A further 20 percent had given up any hope of finding a solution. It's clear that people living with endo are feeling despondent and hopeless when it comes to their sex life.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Orgasms trigger my endometriosis: The sex lives of people with endo\\n            \\n\\n\\nAs someone who was in a medically induced menopause at just 21 due to endometriosis, I know first hand the extent to which the condition can compromise all aspects of your life \\u2014 but perhaps one of the hardest parts to talk about is the impact it can have on your sex life.\\xa0\\n    I know first hand the extent to which the condition can compromise all aspects of your life.\\n    \\nMonthly prostap injections temporarily stop your ovaries from functioning \\u2014 therefore stopping the production of oestrogen. I began prostap while on the waiting list for surgery, in attempts to prevent my endometriosis from worsening during my waiting time.Broaden your views of what 'counts' as sex Sex can become an incredibly alienating topic when it comes to endometriosis, especially when general understandings of sex are confined to heteronormative views on what does or does not \\u2018count\\u2019. Standard penetrative sex can be an incredibly painful experience for women and non-binary people with the condition, which can lead to feelings of guilt and insecurity within an individual. We ask ourselves: \"Is it supposed to feel like this?\" \"Am I doing something wrong?\" \"Why does it look so much easier for everyone else?\" But what we should really be asking is, \"if this doesn\\u2019t work for me, what does?\"On-screen portrayals often depict sex as the most intimate experience we can share with another person, making it seem like a key, non-negotiable and easily obtainable part of romantic relationships. However, this is not always the case. Mainstream pornography and heteronormative sex scenes in films and television shows have largely dictated that sex should look and be a certain way \\u2014 usually involving penis-in-vagina (PIV) sex and favouring positions like missionary and doggy style. In reality, these positions are not accessible or enjoyable for many of us.\\xa0\\n    Sex is much more than just penetration.\\n    \\nReproductive health scientist and sex educator Zoya Ali shared some accurate and accessible advice for people with endometriosis when it comes to improving our sex lives. \"The first thing I would like to address is that sex is much more than just penetration,\" Ali told Mashable. \"Pleasure should be the goal of sex. Working on figuring out what pleasure means for you could help add to intimacy in partnered sex.\"She also emphasised that pain with sex is a particularly common symptom of endometriosis. \"This pain will vary for everyone. For some, it might not even happen. Some might only experience mild pain, while others have reported it to feel like a stabbing shooting pain.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            12 sex tips for disabled people and their partners\\n            \\n\\n\\nThis pain can be impacted by the locations of the\\xa0endometrial lesions, as penetration can cause irritation and inflammation. In short, there is no textbook way to experience endometriosis-related pain during sex, as it impacts individuals so uniquely. For some, orgasms can actually trigger their flare ups, so finding out what is comfortable for you needs to be a completely individualistic approach.\\xa0When it comes to penetrative positions, I have always had a love-hate relationship with missionary and spooning. Before my first surgery, missionary was essentially impossible, with spooning being an easier alternative. Four years on, and two surgeries later, spooning causes me intense discomfort, and missionary, while still uncomfortable at times, can actually be enjoyable on a good pain day. If pain is inconsistent, then, how can we confidently approach sex?Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.It would seem that sometimes, it really is more about the motion of the ocean. \"Focusing on shallower. slower penetration or non-penetrative sex can help ease the pain,\" Ali tells Mashable. \"Usually, the depth, angle, and pace of penetration in a certain position would be what is causing you pain. Any position that shortens the vaginal canal or involves deep penetration, like doggy style, could become painful. Good old missionary can also be painful because of how the uterus gets positioned during intercourse.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            What is pelvic pain and what can you do to treat it?\\n            \\n\\n\\nClinical Sexologist and Therapist Ness Cooper echoed these views, adding that: \"If other organs are affected by endo, it can be hard to recommend a specific position that would help without knowing the individual's pain areas.\" They recommend trying baths, heat pads, or even switching on a heated blanket before getting intimate. This may even make it easier to orgasm, as heat helps to promote a good blood flow throughout the body.\\n    Focusing on shallower. slower penetration or non-penetrative sex can help ease the pain.\\n    \\nWhile not every penetrative position will work for everyone with endometriosis, here are some tips and tricks that Ali and Cooper suggest.To penetrate, or not to penetrate\\u2026\\xa0Missionary doesn\\u2019t have to be a lost cause \\u2014 sometimes we just need to approach things from a different angle\\u2026 literally. Adding pillows or blankets under your hips for additional support has been reported to reduce the pain associated with positions such as this, which is a win for those of us who miss the intimacy of this position.\\xa0Ali added: \"OhNut is a great product to consider for this. It is made of stackable silicone rings that can be worn on the penis and act as a physical barrier to control penetration depth.\"Cooper adds that cock rings may also be helpful for penis-in-vagina penetration in positions that affect the cervix and vaginal canal, as they act as buffers to reduce the penetrable length of the penis.It is key to bear in mind, though, that penetration is not the be-all-or-end-all of sex. Oral sex, fingering, and mutual masturbation are just as important and enjoyable \\u2014 and often much less painful.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The gender health gap makes people's lives hell\\n            \\n\\n\\nAli shares: \"The entire body is capable of being stimulated and pleased. Research has shown that most people prefer some form of clitoral stimulation either alongside or instead of penetration to be able to orgasm.\"\\xa0Both Cooper and Ali suggested massages as a great way of improving intimacy while also soothing pain. \"Mapping out and discovering erogenous zones in your body. We sometimes also forget how sexy kissing, touching, and cuddling can get, so don\\u2019t forget to spend generous amounts of time doing that.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Your ultimate guide to breast play\\xa0\\n            \\n\\n\\nCooper adds: \"Seated sex toys such as the Ruby Glow may provide enjoyable external pleasure and orgasms, whilst the pressure of the sex toy also can feel comfortable even to those with pudendal nerves discomfort or pubis synthesis.\"Giving mutual masturbation a go can also be insightful \\u2014 this way, you are completely in control of the experience, and can navigate your orgasm with full knowledge of what hurts you, and what does not. Masturbating together gives you the freedom to be in total control of your pleasure, so you can navigate your pain while still being intimate with your partner. In doing this, you can also show your partner how you want to be touched.Finally, though most importantly, addressing your sexual boundaries with sexual partners \\u2014new and old \\u2014 is essential. What's off limits for now, or forever? What are you open to trying at some point? Talking about sex can be daunting at the best of times, and endometriosis related struggles can make this more of a challenge. It's important that these conversations happen in a neutral space, outside of the bedroom, at a time when you're not on the cusp of tumbling into bed together.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to perform cunnilingus like a pro\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"It can be a challenging conversation, especially with a new partner,\" Ali shares, \"but effective communication is very important when it comes to partnered sex. Opening up to your partner(s) about what you like and dislike can help make it a more supported, pleasurable and intimate experience for you all.\"By not opening up to your partner, you are putting yourself through unnecessary pain and dealing with it in silence, which, in the long run, could cause hesitation to have sex and ultimately impact your intimate relationship.\"We often overthink the number of times people are having sex during a week, month and even day. When in fact most individuals have sex less than 10 times a month, and some only once a week,\" Cooper shared. It is normal to not want sex all of the time, and for couples to sometimes have mismatched sex drives, especially when endometriosis pain and flare-ups are in the mix.Cooper emphasises that it is incredibly important that, \"if a partner is making you feel guilty about setting boundaries and not wanting sex, it is key to explore the reasons behind why they feel it\\u2019s important and the emotions behind that.\"How can you come to terms with your own boundaries, then, and put them into action?\\xa0Mix up your sex positions As the saying goes, you don\\u2019t know until you try. It\\u2019s important to try new things at your own pace, as this will help you recognise which angles and positions are causing you discomfort.Ali explains: \"Spooning on your side allows you to control the depth of penetration. Since your partner will be penetrating you from behind, it allows for shallow penetration. It also allows your partner to give some loving to the clitoris either with their hands or using toys.\"Getting on top is also worth a try! Positions like the seated lotus or reverse cowgirl allow you to control the depth of penetration and set the pace of the thrusting movement, which is a great way to explore your limits and better understand what is causing your pain. Depending on where your endo and pain is, Doggystyle can also allow for shallow penetration, which is less likely to cause irritation.Keep track of your pain and pick up on triggersKeeping track of patterns and triggers you notice in the correlation between sex and pain is incredibly valuable. \"Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. Was it during, before or after penetration? Was it a certain specific position? Was it at a certain time in your cycle? Did something like lube help?\"You might notice specific points in your cycle when your symptoms flare up. Some people report feeling more pain around the middle and end of their cycle or while on their period.\\xa0\\n    Make a note of the times you experienced pain to understand potential triggers. \\n    \\nCooper told Mashable that \"heated sex toys are probably one of my favourite and most successful recommendations, followed by seated sex toys, and sex position pillows and straps.\"They acknowledge that finding ways to work with chronic pain conditions in the bedroom can be an expensive and draining journey, so it is key to explore as many inexpensive options as you can at different stages of your cycle. What works when you are flaring? What feels good when your pain is a 6/10? What about when you\\u2019re having a good day?Ali adds that: \"Bloating can also be a cause of pain. If you find certain foods trigger your bloating, try avoiding them before you are looking to have sex.\"Ease into itIf you find that the idea of sex is making you anxious, it\\u2019s important to address these feelings \\u2014 you can\\u2019t expect your body to relax if your mind is racing. \"You don\\u2019t have to rush directly into penetration [particularly in penis-to-vagina sex]. Focus on getting yourself aroused and building up to it to give your body time to lubricate naturally, making penetration easier,\" concludes Ali.It\\u2019s important to give yourself time, as the anxiety you are feeling might actually be adding to your pain. Easing into it will help relax your nerves. Ali suggests: \"Take a warm shower together, light up some candles, put on your favourite playlist, whatever gets you going!\"Use lots of lubeIt\\u2019s important to be generous with lube, because a lack of lubrication can cause friction and pain. \"Vaginal dryness can happen with age, hormonal imbalances, certain medications, such as hormonal contraception (which is often prescribed for endometriosis), not being aroused enough etc,\" says Ali. Seek supportFinding support, in whatever form that might take, is invaluable when you have a chronic illness. Online communities have been invaluable for me when it has come to navigating my endometriosis \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s asking questions, needing advice, or just generally wanting to speak to someone who understands, I have always felt welcomed and heard.Endometriosis UK has some great resources, including local support groups with regular meets (both online and in person), and a variety of blogs to read \\u2014 including my own blog on sex and endometriosis.\\xa0\\xa0Ali said: \"If you find that your mental health is also impacting your sex life, you could consider attending counselling or sex therapy yourself or as a couple to navigate your feelings around it and improve communication.\"\"You could also try and explore the option of pelvic floor physiotherapy to understand the cause of the pain and help navigate it.\"The beauty of sex is that it's something we can make completely our own. No one outside of our individual bubbles will know of the intimacy we share with our partner(s), the ways we do it, or the ways we enjoy it. Endometriosis and other chronic pain conditions are not a death sentence for our sex lives \\u2014 they are merely one of the many elements we must consider in order to understand ourselves and our partners. It is time that we stopped aimlessly following the \\u2018rules\\u2019 on how sex should be, and allow ourselves to explore, experience, and enjoy sex on our own terms.",

Why vacuum regularly when you can have a robot handle it for you? Better yet, why empty the dirt and debris out of said vacuum when the robot can do it on its own? The only problem is, self-emptying vacuums aren't always the most affordable models. Some of the best robot vacuums are those that include this great perk. Luckily, one of the cheaper options is on sale now at a price you won't want to pass up. The Walmart-exclusive iRobot Roomba i1+ is on sale right now for $249.99, which is $38 less than its normal price of $288. Given that the iRobot Roomba i1 is $229.99, you're essentially getting the self-emptying dock as a bonus for just $20. The i1+ is, for all intents and purposes, Walmart's answer to the iRobot i3+, which is still $349.99 at Amazon. All that to say, this is a great deal, especially if you hate to get your hands dirty!This Roomba is an expert at cleaning all types of floors, with a three-stage loose and lift system to help you clear debris out of your carpet. It has a battery life of about 75 minutes, and after that, it'll return to its dock to empty all the nasties it collected while on the prowl in your home. You don't need to empty the main reservoir on the dock for up to 60 days, which is great news for anyone who hates cleaning. There are a few bells and whistles you can expect from the pricier models missing, like smart home mapping, but you still get app-controlled scheduling and smart suggestions that you'll want to take advantage. And for the price, you really can't beat this model. Snap it up while it's still available. ",

            "description": "Anti-generative AI advocates can do a little chef's kiss today.That's because Italy's data protection agency announced on Friday a blockage of ChatGPT within the country's borders. Italy has also started an investigation. Called a \"temporary limitation\" in the English translation of the press release, the ban arrives on the grounds that ChatGPT does not adequately protect user data or have any kind of mechanism to prevent minors from using the generative AI service. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The ChatGPT bug exposed more private data than previously thought, OpenAI confirms\\n            \\n\\n\\nUnder Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR), ChatGPT parent company OpenAI has 20 days to comply with the order, or else it could face fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or \\u20ac20 million, whichever is larger.There's a whole host of interesting angles to this. For one, it's hard to argue with Italy's complaints. A recent bug exposed private user chat titles, and OpenAI later admitted the breach was larger than originally thought. There is also a complete lack of gatekeeping for minors.Beyond that, though, is the issue of \"training\" the AI itself. ChatGPT and other AI chat-bots like it basically teach themselves how to act like humans by reading things humans write on the internet, without the consent of said humans. As TechCrunch explained, ChatGPT is able to recite information about individuals while also regularly getting details wrong. There does not appear to be a way for the individuals in question to correct these errors.There's no telling how long this \"temporary limitation\" will last or what Italy's investigation into the matter will find. Just keep in mind that other countries in the European Union have the right to do this under GDPR, too.",

According to the document, Virgin Orbit is making these colossal layoffs \"in order to reduce expenses in light of the Company's inability to secure meaningful funding.\"According to CNBC, who first reported news, Virgin Orbit will also cease operations \"for the foreseeable future,\" as told by CEO Dan Hart to employees during a meeting Thursday.

            "title": "'Rye Lane' takes cues from an unlikely source: 'Peep Show'",
            "description": "One of the year's most delightfully romantic British films takes artistic cues from one of Britain's most brilliantly awkward shows.Rye Lane, the debut feature from director Raine Allen Miller, is a fun, fresh, and genuine love letter to South London, weaving through various locations in Peckham and Brixton over the course of a brilliant day. After a cry-in-the-bathroom meet-cute, Yas and Dom (Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson) can't seem to stop hanging out, wandering around all day together while unpacking their big bad ex stories \\u2014 which leads to frankly the greatest scene of re-meeting an ex in movie history.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Rye Lane' review: Lovable losers rom-com is a total winner\\n            \\n\\n\\nAllen Miller, through cinematographer Olan Collardy, gets right up in Yas and Dom's faces for the majority of the film through point of view shots, meaning Oparah and Jonsson often deliver their lines almost straight down the director's favored fisheye lens. But their gaze is slightly above the camera, and it's this technique that sees Allen Miller borrow from the show that made it famous: Peep Show.\"Peep Show is probably one of the greatest shows of all time in my opinion,\" Allen Miller tells Mashable. \"And it's so funny because it's not a show that anyone would ever talk about, well maybe they would, but I don't think it's really been rated for the craft before.\"\\n\\n\\nSuccession creator Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's lauded sitcom about dysfunctional, twenty-something Croydon flatmates Mark and Jez (David Mitchell and Robert Webb) wielded point of view shots through its signature fisheye lens to create a peephole effect (hence the series' title). Paired with Mitchell and Webb's voiceovers, the effect was one that pitted inner monologue against external, decorous expression, to get inside their most uncensored, usually seedy thoughts (the title's also a nod to illicit films viewed through a peephole). But where Peep Show uses the technique to expose just how little people say what they really mean, and to plunge you into existential discomfort over the sheer mundanity of everyday life, Rye Lane uses it to fuel the sparks between its two romantic leads.\"We called them 'peep shots' when we made the film,\" says Allen Miller, \"because I really love in Peep Show when they do that shot where it's close on the person but they kind of look slightly above the lens. They're not down the barrel because that breaks the fourth wall and it doesn't feel like you're quite in their head or they're talking to another person. It's slightly above the lens so that you're in their head but they're still talking to the other character. And I've always really loved that.\"Using this technique, Yas and Dom's cheeky banter and bubbling flirtation is infectious for the audience, delivered so earnestly to each other but also slightly to the viewer. We see every moment of Yas' swift spontaneity and Dom's sweet awkwardness up close, as they learn more and more about each other.\\n\\n\\nRye Lane doesn't just use the fisheye lens for these \"peep shots\" however, as Allen Miller also uses the lens to frame South London in all its glory, with one-off characters weaving in and out in the background in scenes set in Brixton Market, Brockwell Park, Peckham's Rye Lane Market, and Warwick Gardens \\u2014 a woman battles a gigantic bunch of balloons, a man in a blue cowboy suit dances solo, all while Dom and Yas continue their conversation.\\n\\n\\n\"It is a character in itself. Walking around Brixton and Peckham, you don't know what you're going to get. It's an absolute joy 70 percent of the time, sometimes it's hard, but this film is about South London on a good day, and it's trying to shine a light on it\\u2026that it can be a really great place to be,\" says Allen Miller.\\xa0\"When I moved from Manchester \\u2014 I'm originally from Manchester and I moved to London when I was 12 \\u2014 my grandmother took me on this, like, Goodfellas\\u2026you know the scene in Goodfellas when he takes her through the back of the restaurant and it's all one shot? My grandma did that for me in Brixton Market and she was like, 'This is where you get your jerk spice, this is where you get your plantain,' and it's just this amazing, colourful, wonderful place. And it was so exciting for me to have the opportunity to shine a light on it like this.\"Rye Lane is now in cinemas, and also streaming on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ in the UK.",

            "title": "Why age-verification bills for porn sites won't work",
            "description": "In case you haven't noticed, free expression online is currently under attack. From the proposed TikTok ban to hearings on Section 230 (which protects social platforms from being liable for what users post), some U.S. lawmakers are targeting access to free and open internet.\\xa0Recent age-verification bills are another iteration of this. These laws require people to show proof of age to view adult content \\u2014 or, in some versions, to peruse social media at all. Experts warn that these bills threaten digital privacy and free speech.What are age-verification bills?Last year, Louisiana passed Act 440, which requires visitors to sites with over 33.33 percent of adult content to use a commercial age-verification system (AVS) to prove they're over 18, such as with a government-issued ID. The law went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.An influx of similar bills cropped up across the country afterwards. Utah's SB 287, which requires a commercial AVS for sites that have \"a substantial portion of material that may be harmful to minors\" has been signed into law and will go into effect on May 2. (Utah has also passed two other bills, SB 152 and HB 311, which requires age verification for all users on social media sites; parental permission to access social media for those under 18; and social media curfews for under-18s. These are supposed to go into effect in March 2024, but social media platforms are expected to challenge these laws beforehand).Copycats of the Louisiana law have also passed in Virginia, Mississippi, and Arkansas as well, but have yet to be signed. Such bills have been brought forward in other states too, like Texas and Arizona. The Free Speech Coalition, a porn industry lobby group, has compiled a tracker of age-verification bills.\\xa0In the UK, similar legislation that called for age-verification on porn sites, known as the \"porn block,\" failed in 2019. Last year, the UK government revisited the idea, with critics saying it would cause a \"slippery slope\" for censorship.The downsides to \"porn passport\" lawsWhile these bills may initially seem sound \\u2014 no one wants children to access adult content \\u2014 the experts say that they won't work, and will cause a host of problems.In terms of the former, these statutes are difficult to enforce and easy to get around. For one, there are going to be websites based in other countries that won't comply with these regulations, said Mike Stabile, director of public affairs at the Free Speech Coalition. \"My greatest fear when I looked at [these bills] was that this is\\u2026going to push kids to more and more dangerous sites,\" he said.For another, software like VPNs (virtual privacy networks) are built to make it seem like the user is somewhere they're not. Days after the Louisiana law went into effect, a Redditor asked if they can use a VPN to get around it. \"Yep,\" the top comment read. \"So easy a five year old can do it.\"Beyond enforceability, experts say they cause a tremendous privacy risk.\"The immediate concerns are that there is no foolproof age-verification system that is not intrusive, comprehensive, effective, and can be introduced quickly,\" said Jason Kelley, associate director of digital strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on defending digital rights. Since there aren't systems in place to implement these regulations, tech companies will scramble to respond to these laws. They may do the right thing, or the wrong thing unintentionally, like set up an AVS that's insecure because they don't know how AVS's work, or they may do the wrong thing intentionally to gather up people's data.\\xa0\"You create this whole ecosystem, where people's individual behaviors \\u2014 the websites that they visit \\u2014 can be tracked and connected to their identity,\" Kelley continued. \"We're essentially creating this immediate requirement for people to share their private information alongside their pornography preference with companies that don't necessarily have a system in place to protect that data.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Stripperweb empowered strippers. Where will they go now?\\n            \\n\\n\\nA longer-term concern is that there will be a domino effect, which is already happening with the copycat bills. If they were all to pass, Kelley said we'd have an extremely complicated system where different states accept different forms of verification, which could lead to these websites requiring verification from everyone regardless of state to assure they comply.\\xa0Further, bills like Utah's SB 152 and HB 311 target social media on the whole, and would fundamentally change the internet. Other states are following suit: A proposal in Ohio, for instance, would require parental permission for children to sign up not just for Facebook and YouTube, but \"any online website, online service, online product, or online feature that requires consumer consent to register, sign up, or otherwise create a unique username.\"\"The end result is that we won't have access that's anonymous to much of the web,\" Kelley said of these flurry of age-verification bills, \"which is important for free speech\" and other things, like privacy protection. If all these bills went into effect, many people wouldn't be able to access the internet at all without an ID. As it is, there's a \"digital divide\" where millions of Americans don't have an adequate internet connection at home; verification would only exacerbate this issue of access. While those who do have IDs could get through these barriers, they would need to give up anonymity to do so. \\n    If all these bills went into effect, many people wouldn't be able to access the internet at all without an ID, and those who could access would need to provide documentation.\\n    \\nThat's not the only potential issue. As senior security analyst Max Eddy\\xa0at PCMag (which is owned by Ziff Davis, Mashable's parent company) warned, identity theft could increase in the wake of these laws. It's already happening: \"We've already heard reports of phishing going on in Louisiana, where people are impersonating adult sites, and getting people to upload their ID and then selling those IDs\\u2026for Bitcoin,\" Stabile said. \"We expect that\\u2026identity theft is going to skyrocket.\"\\xa0Users aren't the only people impacted by these laws, either; adult creators are, too.\\xa0Online sex workers are already pushed offline due to bills FOSTA-SESTA, an amendment to Section 230 meant to stop sex-trafficking, but has resulted in the removal (or shadowbanning) of sex workers and remotely sexy content from major social platforms like Facebook and Instagram. (Only a single trafficker has been prosecuted under FOSTA-SESTA in its first five years.) Should age-verification bills progress, the problem will inevitably worsen.\"It's just going to censor us,\" said adult performer and advocate Alana Evans. \"How is it going to affect a platform like Twitter?\" Currently, Twitter does allow adult content, and Evans sees it as the only platform that has a safe space for performers \\u2014 but that status hangs in the balance. \"If Twitter decides that we can't advertise my cam links anymore\" or similar links, she said, \"it would kill my business. It would kill my income.\"Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.How to protect children from adult content\"I worked my butt off to keep my kids away from that material,\" said Evans, who's a parent. \"The most important thing is actually being aware of what your kids are doing in the first place.\" This includes checking their devices and having open conversations about sex and porn. She's had talks with her son, who's now an adult, where she explained that porn isn't real but rather a \"theatrical version\" of sex.\\xa0\"I don't think parents should be afraid of having that conversation,\" Evans said. One reason teens look at porn is simply because they're curious. \"If you're having a conversation with them,\" she continued, \"the curiosity is taken away.\"Like Evans, Stabile also calls on parents to be involved with their kids' internet browsing and to have those conversations. There's lots of content beyond porn that's not appropriate for kids \\u2014 portrayals of violence, for example \\u2014 and it may be impossible to protect kids from seeing any of it, but you can talk to them about it.\\xa0Beyond conversations, Stabile recommends device-level filters that block all websites that are registered RTA, or \"Restricted to Adults.\" \"It signals to filters, whether it's your Apple filter or Net Nanny or something like that, that this site should be blocked,\" he explained. It doesn't matter if a child tries a VPN or some other workaround \\u2014 the site will be blocked on that device.\\xa0The idea behind these bills \"is not wrong,\" said Evans \\u2014 no one, especially those in the adult industry, wants children watching their content. These bills, however, create risks, and can cascade into an online privacy and censorship nightmare that hurts sex workers and other internet users.\\xa0\"If even a few of them [age-verification bills] pass in different contexts, it will be dangerous for everyone in the United States who goes online,\" Kelley warned, \"because we will not be able to access things privately.\"",

It's a subtle, marvellous tribute to the trio's deep connection, filmed as a mix of home video-style clips and intimate cinematography.Anchored by shots of the three making music and sleeping during a rainy night, The Film is basically three connected music videos. Baker tinkers on an old car to \"$20,\" Bridgers sings \"Emily I'm Sorry\" as monster trucks do jumps in slow motion, while Dacus renews a room with bright blue paint to \"True Blue,\" joined by her band members. It's a masterful piece of work by Stewart that honours the tracks and band members individually, but connects them. It's not the first time Stewart has directed music videos, having helmed one for Chvrches in 2017 and Sage + The Saints in 2014. She's also set to adapt Lidia Yuknavitch\\u2019s The Chronology of Water as a feature film.",

            "description": "Twitter wants organizations to verify their employees' Twitter accounts themselves, and it wants them to pay a lot of money to be able to do it. That, in a nutshell, is what Twitter is offering through a new feature called Verified Organizations, launched globally on Friday. \"Verified Organizations is a new way for organizations and their affiliates to distinguish themselves on Twitter. Rather than relying on Twitter to be the sole arbiter of truth for which accounts should be verified, vetted organizations that sign up for Verified Organizations are in full control of vetting and verifying accounts they\\u2019re affiliated with,\" the company said through its Twitter Verified account. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nBusinesses, nonprofits, and organizations of all kind are invited to apply to access Verified Organizations here, and they need to be vetted themselves (by Twitter) before they can start handing out those \"verified\" badges to affiliated accounts. They'll get a gold checkmark and a square avatar if they're a business or non-profit; government or multilateral organizations will get a grey checkmark and a circular avatar. Additional benefits include premium support and all the features that come with Twitter Blue, such as the ability to edit tweets and post longer tweets. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Twitter's new API pricing is killing many Twitter apps that can't pay $42,000 per month\\n            \\n\\n\\nIt all sounds nice until you consider the costs, which aren't mentioned in Twitter's post or the sign up page, but are instead explained in a Help Center post. \"A Twitter Verified Organizations subscription is $1,000/month (plus any applicable tax) and $50/month (plus any applicable tax) for each additional affiliate in the U.S. Prices may vary by region and are subject to change,\" says the post. Prices per region are laid out here, and the costs get a lot higher depending on where the organization is based; for example, the cost of base subscription in Italy is \\u20ac1,159 ($1,261), with an additional cost of \\u20ac61 ($66) per month per affiliate. \\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternative Social Networks to Replace Twitter, Facebook, and More\\n\\n\\n\\nCommenting on the launch, Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted that it's \"important to establish whether someone actually belongs to an organization or not so as to avoid impersonation.\" While that may be important for some organizations, it'll be interesting to see how many will choose to cough up the non-trivial cost of Verified Organizations' fee, especially if they're non-profits. The Verified Organizations feature comes a day ahead Twitter's planned removal of all blue checkmarks for individuals and businesses who haven't signed up for Twitter Blue, which costs $8 per month. Besides losing their checkmarks, individuals and businesses that don't pay won't show up on Twitter's \"For You\" page, and won't be allowed to vote in Twitter polls. ",

            "description": "Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new frontier of entertainment that has yet to attract mainstream appeal. But with more industry giants throwing their hats into the metaverse as of late \\u2014 looking at you, Apple, Sony, and Meta \\u2014 an intrigue exists for gamers and techies in pursuit of next-level immersion.After a period of hands-on testing, we've decided to recommend the Meta Quest 2 ($399.99), the PlayStation VR2 ($549.99), and the Valve Index VR Kit ($999). All three VR headsets are consumer-friendly devices that felt comfortable during hours of use, supported a breadth of features and content upon unboxing, and performed well at their respective price points.While sourcing contenders for this roundup, we chose to test VR headsets that are making waves in the small-but-growing market, whether they're known for their libraries, innovations, or both. All of them are true, dedicated VR headsets with built-in screens, as opposed to mobile headsets that require a smartphone. (Some, but not all, are tethered headsets that require a connection to a separate console or PC.) We also excluded enterprise-level units that are designed for business and commercial use.Here's a deeper dive into the VR headsets we've tried and returned to again and again.",

            "description": "Call me lazy, but DIY'ing has never really been my thing \\u2014 especially as it relates to my beauty routine. Sure, the pandemic forced me to swap my in-salon beauty visits with failed attempts of at-home versions of the same thing, but when it comes to products, I lack inspiration to make my own. Even though I don't have the time or energy to put together at-home concoctions, I have a fascination of watching social media users create enviable avocado-honey hair masks, brown sugar lip scrubs, and, more recently, face masks. This is what led me to BioFace.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            All the best skincare tech that we tested and loved, and some that we didn\\u2019t\\n            \\n\\n\\nJust when I thought I'd seen it all, a midnight doomscroll on TikTok had me face to face with videos of users pouring raw fruits and vegetables (and sometimes questionable ingredients like chocolate) into a device wherein minutes later, a jelly-like mask formed. Even as a non-DIYer, I was intrigued and knew I had to try it out for myself. Could this have the potential to turn me into a DIY convert? Spoiler alert: It did \\u2014 but with some caveats.How BioFace works\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe BioFace machine gives you the freedom to try different ingredients in your skincare routine.\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\nBioFace is a device that allows you to create customized, at-home face masks using real fruits and vegetables. It comes with collagen tablets that you're meant to add into the machine along with water and your desired fruit and/or vegetable liquids. The machine mixes all of the ingredients together, then spews out the blend into the attached mold (which is shaped like a sheet mask with cutouts for your nose and mouth) for it to cool. Eventually, after five minutes, the mixture solidifies in its tray and resembles a sheet mask (without the sheet). Texture-wise, it's a cross between a hydrogel mask and Jell-O.Using BioFaceUsing the machine is pretty straightforward. There are voice commands to guide you through the step-by-step process, rendering the included user manual unnecessary (though you'll still want to keep it handy, as it provides useful recommendations for which fruits and vegetables you can add in, plus their skincare benefits).I've used BioFace to incorporate several ingredients into my face mask (including raspberries and aloe), but my favorite ingredient to use is watermelon for its brightening, hydrating benefits. To start, I mashed up my watermelon chunks into a bowl. (PSA: It would be nice if the machine had a mash or blend function to make this step easier.) You'll really need to liquify your desired fruit or vegetable or mash it up into very fine pieces, as the hole you'll be pouring into is fairly small. After mashing the watermelon chunks until they were liquidy and small enough to fit into the hole, I used the included measuring cup to pour it into the machine along with the recommended amount of water and one collagen tablet. I replaced the cap, pushed the start button, and the waiting game began.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust pour in your ingredients.\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd out comes a jelly-like face mask.\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShortly after, the machine began to steam and make mixing sounds. Five minutes later, the machine prompted me to attach the mask tray in preparation for the mixture to come out. Once fully mixed, the mask was ready to go into its mold: I pushed the eject button and out came the red blend, straight into the tray that I had attached. I then used the included spatula to evenly spread the mask into the tray (FYI: You'll have to use a good amount of your active ingredient in order for the end result to fully fill up the tray). Then, I waited a few minutes for the mask to solidify and cool. The instructions say you can use the mask while it's warm, but I prefer putting it in my skincare fridge for a few minutes after it solidifies for more of a cooling skin effect.Some downsidesThe machine doesn't come without a few downsides. For one, the collagen tablets. There's little research supporting the benefits of applying topical collagen onto the skin, and it's unknown what else is in the collagen tablets, which could potentially lead to skin irritation and sensitivities. The mask mold tray also has its quirks \\u2014 the cutouts for the eyes and nose are too small, and I found that I had to remove some pieces of the mask in these areas to make it fit my face, which can get a bit messy. Finally, as mentioned, the machine would be more user-friendly if it offered a function to blend your fruits and vegetables \\u2014 one less dirty bowl is a win in my book.Is BioFace worth it?Right off the bat, I see several benefits to a machine like this. For one, it's great for those leaning into a simpler skincare routine \\u2014 you have full control over the actives that go on your skin (do you want the brightening effects of orange juice or the skin-evening benefits of carrots?). It also helps reduce waste, both in your beauty routine and in your kitchen, whether you're sick of denting your wallet on single-use sheet masks or have a tin of raspberries about to go bad. I also appreciate the self-cleaning feature of the machine, which you can do right after making your mask or later on as its own function.As far as the mask itself, my skin thoroughly enjoys them. I've never experienced any irritation or redness with any mask I've made \\u2014 impressive considering my skin is super sensitive. Rather, my skin always feels rejuvenated, fresh, and hydrated after using the masks, especially if I apply them cold.Overall, the machine is easy to use, takes little to no trial and error to get right, and is a fun way to incorporate natural foods into your skincare routine. It's also just plain fun feeling like your own beauty mixologist. I don't see myself using this in place of my in-person facials with my esthetician, but it's definitely a good way to upkeep my skin in between visits, especially as I lean into a more eco-friendly beauty routine away from single-use sheet masks. It may also be a nice choice for those who don't necessarily have the budget to purchase store-bought face masks on a regular basis.",

            "description": "\"If there's a glowup challenge, I'm gonna slay,\" writes Emira D'Spain in the caption of one of her glimmeringly saturated TikTok posts. Her page is full of makeup recommendations, beauty tutorials,\\xa0and plastic surgery vlogs, but this post stands out, a quick montage of childhood photos showing pre-transition D'Spain. It's tagged #TransAndProud\\U0001f3f3\\ufe0f\\u200d\\u26a7\\ufe0f.\\xa0\\xa0With more than a million followers on the app, D'Spain has solidified a place in the culture. Her buzz online largely falls within three main areas: her popular social pages, news about her being the first Black transgender model signed to Victoria's Secret, or coverage about her recent gender confirmation surgery.\\xa0The 26-year-old is either a \"TikTokker turned model\" or a \"viral beauty influencer\" \\u2014 both of which are true \\u2014 but she told Mashable those simplified titles are a little bit misleading.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            As U.S. leaders debate a TikTok ban, lawmakers and creators clash over generational and social differences\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"I went to NYU on a merit-based scholarship, and I was top of my class in marketing and communications,\" she said. D'Spain studied in Paris and wrote her thesis on forms of anonymity in online spaces. \"I was a very studious girlboss. I was working for a marketing agency, so I was booking influencers for campaigns and coming up with campaign concepts for brands. I have such a broad, 360 understanding of this whole industry. I went from marketing to editorial to talent.\"Descriptions of D'Spain's rise to popularity often\\xa0leave out her career before TikTok, which was already well on its way toward fashion prominence. D'Spain had led editorial content at Paper magazine since her beginnings as a college intern, and curated a following with the magazine's first YouTube beauty series, Snatchural. By 2021, she was the magazine's beauty director and her TikTok page, started as a cross-posting effort amid pandemic lockdown fever, was gaining numbers, as well.\\xa0Part of this was due in part to D'Spain's bubbly, bare-it-all openness about her identity as a trans woman, which became the guiding perspective for the publication's beauty coverage.\\xa0\"I've never once been questioned for who I am,\" she reflected on her personal and professional support system. \"Everyone has let me blossom and let me be me. It's really paid off.\"\\n\\n\\nOn Oct. 3, 2021, D'Spain officially announced her name change to the magazine's readers, taking to the site that had cemented her place in the online fashion canon. The Paper article, written by D'Spain in her quintessential \"bestie\" voice to the readers who had followed her beauty career, cited other openly trans celebs like YouTuber Gigi Gorgeous, actor and model Hunter Schafer, and actor Elliot Page as inspiration.\\xa0\"This past weekend I threw a literal BIRTH day for myself and my new name \\u2014 debuting as Emira D'Spain. There are few transgender women who have the platform I do (let alone trans women of color) and this birthday served as an opportunity to introduce myself but also to leverage my platform for the greater health and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community,\" she wrote. \"Of course, I started preparing all my looks months in advance to look perfect for this pivotal moment.\"From there, it all took off.\\xa0\\n    I'm not just like every other beauty bitch. There's so much more to the story.\\n    \\nD'Spain became the trailblazing pioneer of TikTok's iteration of Get Ready With Me (GRWM) videos \\u2014 the app's #GRWM tag now has more than 85 billion videos. Her community of so-called \"C*nty Barbies\" delighted in her daily content about the beauty industry, her routine and product recommendations, and her gradual shift from behind-the-scenes to the talent side of the beauty industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    View this post on Instagram\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\\nUshering in magazine covers and a wave of runway work (culminating in her walking at New York Fashion Week this year), D'Spain became a history-making addition to the Victoria's Secret lineup of models in 2022, which, she says, wasn't presented to her as a diversity or representational push from a company facing its own controversy and rebrand.\\xa0\"It was more so, 'We love your look.' It was not a really crazy PR push from there. We didn't really expect it to pop off and become a whole thing,\" D'Spain remembers. Instead, her followers and the larger beauty community celebrated the deal as an inclusivity win, following a long battle for trans inclusion that gained traction years prior, as the world clamored for model Carmen Carrera to become the first trans woman to sport the angel wings.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis beauty-first mentality is at the heart of D'Spain's online posting ethic. Mashable asked her where she feels her place is on an app like TikTok, which has become a community-building and organizing space for young, LGBTQ people.\\xa0\"I think my brand is very fun, big-sister energy. I never had a big sister, so I've always wanted to be that for other people,\" she said. Presenting her expertise and growing popularity in the beauty industry is a form of visibility in and of itself, she says, and her broad commitment to authenticity often means trans identity is also folded into the glittery mix. \"Simply existing on TikTok and sharing my life as a trans woman of color in New York City \\u2014 living the life that I do, having the friends and experiences and education that I have, all these things that are so unique to me \\u2014 gives people a broader understanding of what a trans person looks like,\" D'Spain explained. \"We're just people. [My identity] is not some weird thing, something that they have these preconceived notions about in their head, especially with older generations.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Emira D'Spain\\n\\n\\nUnlike many other LGBTQ creators on TikTok, though, D'Spain explained that she decided to step away from using her page as an educational or organizing tool. \"I chose to build my platform that way because I didn't want to center my identity around being trans. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it didn't feel authentic to my personality and who I am,\" she explained. \"I don't see my account sitting within the queer creator community, because I don't want to take away from the content that they're creating. I feel like for a lot of queer creators that focus their platforms around their identity, they're talking about activism and they're talking about politics \\u2014 things that matter, things that are changing our world and that we have to fight for. And while, yes, I try to talk about those things in a light-hearted, funny way, it's not what I came on the app to do.\"D'Spain's honest assessment of her page's place in the TikTok ecosystem is a refreshing note within an influencer system that often rewards superficial claims of activism. But she may be selling herself a bit short: Even though LGBTQ politics might not be a specific bullet point in her page's brand description or a common topic in her daily vlogging, she's still making an effort to advance the cause.For instance, D'Spain's announcement of her XOXOEmira change was paired with a fundraiser for the National Center for Transgender Equality. For TikTok's 2022 celebration of Transgender Day of Visibility, D'Spain and Paper joined other creators for the app's #TransVisibility takeover, which recognized TikTok as a \"place to give voice and visibility to historically marginalized communities by amplifying their voices.\" They also promoted and donated to the It Gets Better Project and Trans Lifeline.\\xa0In February, D'Spain was recognized as a TikTok Visionary Voice, joining other Black creators honored for their significant contributions to the app, and now, on Transgender Day of Visibility, she will be recognized as a leading voice among TikTok's LGBTQ community.\\xa0And although her content is not centered on activism, her Get Ready With Me, big-sister approach has resonated with a massive audience, extending a hand of familiarity and acceptance by sharing huge moments in her life. D'Spain debated joining the public conversation about gender affirmation surgeries \\u2014 highly politicized, yet life-saving procedures that she ultimately did choose to vlog about, herself. \"My biggest accomplishment is continuing my transition in the public eye,\" she said. Her February TikTok video chronicling her gender affirmation surgery has more than 10 million views.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"I went back and forth for six months, actually, deciding whether or not I was going to talk about it online. I really didn't want to, but I felt that I had to,\" she said. \"And I am glad that I did. I want [my audience] to see that I'm not just a pretty face putting on makeup. I'm not just like every other beauty bitch. There's so much more to the story.\"D'Spain's comments pose additional questions: Should her worth as a representational force in a highly exclusive, historically problematic industry depend on how much activism we see on her feeds? How much of her personal story needs to be on display? Is her presence enough?\"I don't know if I ever felt like I was that accepted in the beauty space until now, and even then there are still tables in which there are not seats for me,\" she said, quickly transitioning the serious lean of the conversation into her trademarked positive outlook. \"But I think it's fine. It's like\\u2026goals and missions to accomplish. Life would be so boring if I was accepted into every single thing that I wanted. What would be the point? What would I fight for?\"On her extremely upbeat outlook, truly a feat given the challenging social and political environment she's operating in, D'Spain said, \"I'm a very positive person. Sometimes it's a little much. It gives toxic positivity, even for myself.\" She's made an intentional effort to avoid negativity, she explained. \"We're all going to die. We're all going to be eaten by worms one day. So why are we going to be frowning about it?\"\\n    My biggest piece of advice to every trans person out there is to take your time. There is no rush.\\n    \\nD'Spain's positivity isn't just up against general and politicized negativity toward her life and identity, she's also choosing to solidify her career in a space that's facing its own foundation-shaking scrutiny. Traditional beauty content and product marketing, as well as their opponents, have found in TikTok an arena for dialogue and deconstruction. Pro- and anti-aging creators stand opposite each other, selling products or convincing women of their worth beyond their appearance. Advocates for and against plastic surgery discuss the normalization of procedures to young audiences and the practice of professionals offering unprompted \"cosmetic advice.\" Many others are promoting the notion of complete body neutrality.\\xa0As she chronicles her various, gender-affirming cosmetic treatments or posts ad spots with beauty brands, what does D'Spain think about it all?\"In terms of preservation,\" she explained, noting that she despises both the phrases \"anti-aging\" and \"pro-aging,\" \"what you want to preserve with your face, or what you want to take care of with your body, it's such an individual choice. I don't think anyone should be judging another person for it.\" Gender affirmation also factors into her perspective on the beauty world.\"I think a lot of trans people really heavily focus their identity, and their trans identity, around their external beauty, around 'passing' or looking like the gender they identify with,\" she explained, noting her experience is just that: her own. \"I feel like you have to do the internal work first. My biggest piece of advice to every trans person out there is to take your time. There is no rush. You don't have to have all the plastic surgery work done, the hair, lashes, makeup \\u2014 embrace who you are. Embrace your body. Know that your gender identity is your gender identity. You are already that person. And you will get there over time.\"For decades, trans bodies have been interrogated, socially policed, and made the epicenter of legislative debates about human rights. In many communities, queer or straight, the problematic notion of \"passing,\" or not being perceived as transgender, (something D'Spain gets comments about a lot) has rendered many complex conversations about gender presentation and social acceptance into superficial conversations on beauty. But with perspectives like that shared by D'Spain and other strikingly open folks like her, many hope the public perception of trans and gender nonconforming identities will evolve beyond this limited scope and closer to the reality of affirmation and transformation. \"The trans experience is just so special. Over time, your relationship with beauty becomes less toxic. It becomes less about concealing, about hiding, and more about coming into yourself.\"",

            "title": "'Rye Lane' review: Lovable losers rom-com is a total winner",
            "description": "Out of Sundance 2023, Rye Lane shined bright, becoming one of our faves out of the prestigious fest. In her feature directorial debut, Raine Allen-Miller brings scads of style and astounding energy to a joyous and juicy tale of lovable losers who find romantic redemption in South London. Not only does it boast charming lead performances by David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah, but this cheeky romantic comedy also contains what Mashable UK Editor Shannon Connellan called \"the greatest scene of re-meeting an ex in cinema history.\" Now coming to Hulu, Rye Lane demands to be added to your watch list.\\xa0Rye Lane pays tribute to romantic comedies, while gleefully subverting them.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\\n\\n\\nLike many a rom-com that's come before, Rye Lane is set in a bustling city, where two total opposites fall in love thanks to happenstance and eventual open-heartedness. However, the screenplay from Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia plays with breezy tropes by turning a meet-cute into a meet-cringe. Rather than an adorable \"how we met\" anecdote that'll thrill dinner party guests, Yas (Vivian Oparah) and Dom (David Jonsson) meet in the toilets, where he is sobbing loudly over a devastating breakup. From there, it's not so much sparks that fly as an uncomfortable series of embarrassments, like trying to part ways on the street \\u2014\\xa0only to discover you're headed in the same direction. The horror!\\xa0Thankfully, Yas is a garrulous extrovert who refuses to recognize an awkward pause, barreling right through to probe for trauma dumps. Though meek and shy, Dom can't resist the warmth of the spotlight she shines on him, and so the two stumble into an accidental date that'll trek around South London, specifically the eponymous neighborhood of Rye Lane.\\xa0 Along the way, there will be rom-com requisites like bouncy banter, painfully hip romantic rivals, grand gestures, and outrageous shenanigans. There's even a clever cameo, alluding to perhaps the most iconic London-set rom-com, Love Actually. But amid all this, Rye Lane pushes for something more surreal and strange, making it thrillingly unique.\\xa0When recounting bad breakups or early childhood ambitions, Allen-Miller doesn't just shoot a bog-standard walk-and-talk or a cozy coffee shop conversation. Instead, Rye Lane crash-lands audiences into fourth wall-breaking flashbacks wherein modern-day Dom and Yas burst in like the Ghosts of Christmas Past to snoop about and ask probing questions. So, Yas's story about hummus and giving head is staged like a theatrical production, with an audience full of Doms cheers her on. This device thrusts us not only into the perspectives of our lovestruck duo by welcoming us into memories and revenge fantasies but also electrifyingly illustrates their connection. They could be heroes for each other \\u2014 if they could just get out of their own heads!Rye Lane comes alive with color.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\\n\\n\\nThe immersiveness of this enthralling rom-com doesn't stop with these mind plunges. Allen-Miller captures Rye Lane and its assortment of shops, street art, and eccentric characters with such passion and detail that you can almost smell the burritos baking or reach out and touch the fresh produce glistening in the brightly painted stalls. As Dom and Yas stroll by shops, bus stops, or playgrounds, every sequence is popping with color and motion.\\xa0Cinematography sweeps around these could-be lovers with an energy that nods to Allen-Miller's background helming colorful commercials. Low angles play up the juicy intensity when exes collide. But most effective is how cinematographer Olan Collardy employs a first-person perspective for pivotal interactions. Like the riotous hit sitcom Peep Show, POV shots pitch us into the pastel-colored sneakers of Dom and Yas, allowing us the take part in the delicious anxiety of first flirtations.\\xa0As to color: Teal, sunflower yellow, flamingo pink, and bright red explode from costumes, murals, and awnings. In the background, a pair of dancing children's clothes reflect the wall art behind them, as if they'd sprung to life from the art itself. Elsewhere, a shirtless, pot-bellied man protrudes from a window, overlooking his garden, lost in thought. A wannabe cowboy glistens in glitter from head to toe, quipping and tipping his wide-brimmed hat. Across it all, music bobs and weaves, bringing energy and joyous, uninhibited sing-alongs that tempt you to join in for the chorus at least.\\xa0The liveliness of the settings suggests that Rye Lane is not just a magical spot for Dom and Yas, but that we could follow anybody passing through and be welcomed into another warm and wonderful tale. That's how alive this movie's world feels.\\xa0Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson are beyond charming in Rye Lane.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\\n\\n\\nAll these sensory splendors could be for nothing if it weren't for the two leads whose hearts pump at the core of this radiant rom-com. Thankfully, Oparah and Jonsson are dynamite together, whether bickering or breaking into a karaoke duet for the ages. Out the gate, Jonsson is faced with a hurdle: how to be a crushworthy rom-com hero when you begin weeping in a public restroom? Jonsson gamely plays the fool for love, but he shrewdly keeps Dom's mopiness comical rather than morose. Within his trembling grin and cocked eyebrow, resilience flickers. The more he's exposed to Yas's boldness, the more Dom revives. Jonsson reflects this growth in a physicality that steadily shifts from cowering to confident. Dom may begin as a doormat \\u2014\\xa0tromped on by love gone wrong \\u2014 but by the mid-way, he's stood up to be Yas's partner in crime for a hilariously ill-concieved breaking-and-entering.\\xa0For her part, Oparah begins as bombastic, a human firework popping with brash pronouncements, jolting jokes, and bold moves that sometimes involve petty acts of vandalism involving a menstrual cup. However, as the date goes on, the cracks in Yas's confident veneer begin to show. While Dom's vulnerabilities make him soft, Yas's hold sharp edges that lead to chaotic comedy with an undercurrent of self-doubt.\\xa0Overall, Rye Lane is a rhythmically bouncy romantic romp that keeps things fun even when running into the rougher corners of romance. A kickin' soundtrack, vivid color palette, and lively setting blooming with detail add oomph to the film's fun and enthralling attitude. Yet Oparah and Jonsson keep things from feeling one-note or too fluffy by lacing in the relatable cringe of heartache, jealousy, self-doubt, and fear of rejection. So when the stakes hit, they hit good and bracing, allowing us the space to yearn ahead of a finale that's made for big, fat smiles.\\xa0Simply put. Rye Lane is a winsome delight, alive with color, verve, humor, and heart. If you love rom-coms, it's essential viewing. And if you don't, well, this gem might just change your mind.\\xa0Rye Lane is now streaming exclusively on Hulu. ",

            "title": "'Tetris' review: This movie is far better than it has any right to be",
            "description": "A Tetris movie sounds like a punchline about how Hollywood has truly run out of ideas. After a sea of sequels, remakes, and movie adaptations based on every kind of toy on the market, a film based on a video game in which you arrange blocks seems like it should be a bridge too far. It should be stupid. And frankly, this Tetris gets a tad stupid, albeit in a brilliant way. Combining the stranger-than-fiction story of its making with an ardent embrace of the game's aesthetic and nostalgia for the era more broadly, Tetris is a surprisingly smart, silly, and satisfying adventure.\\xa0I entered a cynic and came out grinning like a fool.\\xa0Tetris is the true story of Henk Rogers and Alexey Pajitnov.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Apple TV+\\n\\n\\nScripted by Noah Pink, Tetris introduces us to Dutch video game designer Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) in 1988, as he's witnessing a demo of Tetris at a convention in Las Vegas; it dawns on him that he's watching nothing less than the future of gaming. As the founder of Bullet-Proof Software, Henk is eager to make a deal for Tetris's international rights, and he tries to broker with a British firm as well as Nintendo. But all his hard work \\u2014\\xa0and life's savings \\u2014 are put at risk when it turns out the Russian government owns the game and has no intention of playing fair.\\xa0Caught in the Cold War crosshairs of this battle of business, politics, and shady dealings is Tetris inventor Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov), a Soviet computer engineer with a love of games. What began as a hobby became a viral sensation \\u2014\\xa0in the era of floppy disks, no less! With the possibility that Tetris could bring major money into the Soviet Union, it's not Pajitnov who makes the call on who'll distribute his puzzle game. It's up to a government that is falling apart at the seams and increasingly corrupt.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Tetris' appreciates the magic of making video games\\n            \\n\\n\\nAmid political intrigue, none-too-subtle threats from the KGB, and harassment from bullish British billionaires, Henk and Alexey form an unlikely friendship that will be tested as Tetris's future is determined.\\xa0Taron Egerton is precisely the star Tetris demands.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Apple TV+\\n\\n\\nAs much of the movie consists of Henk bouncing from one business meeting to another contract negotiation, Tetris director Jon S. Baird faced a major obstacle in keeping this seemingly banal string of events entertaining. In combatting the threatening tedium of business, business, business, his secret weapon is the Welsh actor who's brought unflinching verve to the working-class superspy of Kingsman, the plucky underdog of Eddie the Eagle, and the blinding charisma of Elton John in Rocketman.Right out the gate, Tetris welcomes us in with the guileless smile and can-do attitude that exudes from under Egerton's bushy, deeply '80s mustache. Playing a man born in Denmark but raised in New York, he affects an American accent with a romping enthusiasm that gently reflects the capitalist expectation that everything is for sale and the never-say-die optimism that's fueled American business of this era. This is where the open enthusiasm of Egerton's persona is key. While there's an air of The Founder's opportunistic businessman about him, Henk's passion for Tetris isn't only tied to his conviction it'll be a hit but also his genuine love of the game itself.\\xa0Greed isn't good to Henk; games are good. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best movies out of SXSW 2023 and where to watch them\\n            \\n\\n\\nHis enthusiasm is contagious, ushering the audience back into the experience of discovering the iconic puzzle game and its mesmerizing, addictive wonders for the first time. This effusiveness binds us to Henk as he bounds around the globe, from his family's crowded Tokyo apartment to Nintendo's secret R&D offices in Seattle, to self-important multimedia offices in London, and even to the off-limits government buildings in Moscow. As the tension ratchets up, turning the stakes to life or death, Egerton's charm goes from a lure to a floatation device, assuring us he'll see us through with the confident glimmer in his eye.\\xa0Tetris comes alive with elements from the game.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Apple TV+\\n\\n\\nThe other major tool to keeping Tetris moving and fun \\u2014 even as it stumbles into the muck of business and corruption \\u2014\\xa0is how Baird works in elements from the game. From the start, 8-bit animation is used to spice up the film's aesthetic. Chapter titles introduce \"players,\" complete with 8-bit avatars of Henk, Alexey, and their friends and foes. Standard establishing shots of locations, like a convention center or Hank's home, are substituted with 8-bit illustrations as a new \"chapter\" title card is introduced.\\xa0Elsewhere, the subtitles use a font that harkens back to the sharp lines of '80s video games, while the music blaring in an underground club embraces the outrageousness of Western culture of the time and its sheer gusto. When Henk rocks out to Europe's \"The Final Countdown,\" I dare you not to bop along. Elsewhere in the soundscape, sound effects pulled from old-school games replace real-life sounds, like pinging footsteps, which bring an added zing to simple actions. The animation of falling blocks appears as a dreamy overlay as Henk waxes poetic about the magic of the Tetris game. All of this plays in sharp contrast to the starkly gray, cold, and concrete world of Moscow, where things are bleak and utterly lacking the dazzle of Tetris's colorful graphics and zinging score.\\xa0This weird juxtaposition reaches its zenith during a climactic car chase scene that's scored by the Tetris game music. It's ludicrous! It's stupid! It's glorious! It playfully winks that the movie is taking some serious liberties from the real story! The car itself jumps out of its metal reality and transforms into an 8-bit automobile. Rather than undercutting the stakes of this escape attempt, Baird's playful flourishes give the audience a visual reminder of what Henk and Alexey are racing toward. It's not just a game but the dream of sharing their creative vision with the world, breaking down barriers of what is and what could be, and the crushing tedium of our day-to-day, eight bits at a time! Style and star power can't smooth out all of Tetris's rough edges, though. Despite Baird's best efforts, the second act gets a bit bogged down in scenes away from our two heroes. These sequences draw the distinction between the movie's heroic dreamers and their greedy, cold-hearted business antagonists. These villains are a drag because they are such staunch stereotypes of greed, entitlement, and cynicism. While these figures are another very '80s element, snarling at the decade's vices, a little goes a long way with such characters. Yet Baird has an even longer way to go with them, which means repeating the same punchlines and posturing again and again. Still, Tetris is way better a movie than I dared hope. I loved the game growing up, as was expected of the Game Boy Generation. Admittedly, the trailer teased a self-aware sense of wit, playing this Cold War thriller like a zany comedy. Still, I had my doubts going in, because on its face a movie based on Tetris seems absurd. Despite my reservations, I can't deny this biopic is downright delightful. At times, Baird struggles with balancing the tone of Henk's whimsical enthusiasm with the furrow-browed intensity of the Soviet spy schtick. Overall, Tetris is a thrilling romp full of humor, heart, and a kinetic message of hope. Tetris is now available on Apple TV+. \\nUPDATE: Mar. 29, 2023, 4:47 p.m. EDT Tetris was reviewed out of its World Premiere at the SXSW Film Festival. It has been republished to toast its debut on Apple TV+. \\n",

            "description": "Well, it happened. The Wiskayok High School Yellowjackets have officially cannonballed into cannibalism, feasting on their fallen pal, Jackie (Ella Purnell), after she was barbecued, nay, slow-roasted and smoked on her own funeral pyre.In Season 2, episode 2, \"Edible Complex,\" the entire ravenous team excepting Coach Ben (Steven Krueger) emerge from their fireside slumber to the long-missed wafts of cooked meat infiltrating their cabin in the woods. Outside, they find Jackie steaming and well-done after a fateful snow drift alters her cremation. And in one of Yellowjackets' most intense sequences, cutting between reality and a surreal Dionysian banquet, the Yellowjackets tear their friend to pieces to the bleak sounds of Radiohead's \"Climbing Up the Walls.\" \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            5 hidden clues in the 'Yellowjackets' Season 2 opening credits\\n            \\n\\n\\nIt's this scene that'll be in the back of your mind if you rewatch one scene from Season 1, episode 1, set before the plane crash. Attending a party the night before they're set to depart for Nationals as the state champions, some of the Yellowjackets are seething. Earlier, Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) had taken her competitive nature out on freshman Allie during a training match \\u2014 if you've forgotten that juicy compound fracture, allow me to reopen that wounded memory. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaissa's plan to \"freeze out\" Allie did not go exactly to plan, but it worked.\\nCredit: Paul Sarkis / Showtime\\n\\n\\nA tense confrontation between Shauna (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) and Taissa leads to an argument. Natalie (Sophie Thatcher), Van (Liv Hewson), Lottie (Courtney Eaton), and Laura Lee (Jane Widdop) join in and start throwing insults at each other. Jumping in as the team captain she is, Jackie drags her teammates to a private spot away from the party, trying to mediate. \"We're about to go to Nationals, and based on what I'm looking at right now, we might as well not even bother getting on that plane,\" says Jackie. In hindsight, maybe she should have let them have it out at the party. \\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch the 'Yellowjackets' cast absolutely crush Mash Libs\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the copse, Jackie requests that her Yellowjackets line up, then, one by one, they're asked to \"say one nice, true thing about every other girl on this team.\" Laura Lee's generic, faith-driven compliments fall flat, but Jackie pulls deeply thoughtful compliments for her friends out of nowhere. \"Taissa Turner, you have more fight in you than anyone I've ever known. I'm inspired by your determination. Vanessa Palmer, your smile makes me feel happy every time I see it. Laura Lee, I truly admire your faith. Nat, I love that you don't care what anybody thinks, you're so completely yourself.\"Eventually, the other girls cooperate, saying lovely things about each other and causing Shauna and Taissa to make amends. Finally, Jackie does Shauna.\"Shauna Shipman, you are a terrible dancer and you have seriously questionable taste in music and you can't hold your liquor for shit. But you're the only one who's always been there for me. You're the best friend I've ever had.\" It's extremely odd rewatching this scene knowing that these girls Jackie is praising, including her best friend, will make a literal meal of her. You just never know whether the pals you're complimenting today will be gorging themselves on your spleen tomorrow.

            "title": "'Yellowjackets' watch: Who is Misty's new friend, PuttingtheSICKinForensics?",
            "description": "In Season 1 of Yellowjackets, Misty Quigley was the only citizen detective we needed to keep an eye on. True crime-obsessed, Misty proved a friend indeed when her friend in need, Shauna, needed help disposing of the body of her slain lover Adam. Season 2 begins with Misty grilling Shauna in a mock interrogation, just to cover their bases. But could Misty have met her match with a mysterious man online?\\xa0On the citizen detective message boards that Misty frequents as \"AfricanGrey,\" a potential rival has arisen. A user with the handle \"PuttingtheSICKinForensics\" has been focusing his amateur sleuthing on the missing person's case of Adam Martin, which could be disastrous for Team Yellowjackets. So, who is this guy?\\xa0Let's chase down the clues each week to uncover this Yellowjackets mystery.\\xa0Who is PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Scott Kirkland/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nFrom the trailers for Season 2, we know Christina Ricci, who plays present-day Misty, shares scenes with fellow '90s icon Elijah Wood. Plus, the Lord of the Rings star's sprightly voice is easily identifiable in episode one, \"Friends, Romans, Countrymen,\" as the voiceover source of fellow online citizen detective PuttingtheSICKinForensics; Wood is also listed as Walter in the show's credits. In this first ep, Misty is infuriated to find Adam Martin's (Peter Gadiot) disappearance has become the focus of\\xa0PuttingtheSICKinForensics. More worrisome, her fellow sleuthing fan is on the right track, posting a theory that Adam's disappearance might be blamed on an unknown girlfriend. To save Shauna from suspicion, Misty uses her reputation as a well-reputed citizen detective to malign this theory. But could there be clues within Walter's initial post?\\xa0Amid the tedious telegraph schtick, Walter notes that he's gotten ahold of Adam's bank statements, and from the charges has determined the missing man had a new love interest. Of course, he's onto something. But how did Walter get ahold of Adam's bank statements? Maybe he's a savvy hacker. Maybe, like Natalie's former sponsor, he works at a bank. Maybe he's pulled a Misty, getting his hands dirty by going through Adam's trash. By the end of episode 1, we have no way of knowing for sure.\\xa0What does Episode 2 tell us about PuttingtheSICKinForensics?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIn Season 2 episode 2 (\"Edible Complex\"), Walter makes his first appearance on Yellowjackets while making an intriguing impression on Misty.\\xa0It begins with Misty reaching out on the f/BureauofCitizenDetectives message board for help hacking the motel security camera, so she might uncover what happened to Nat. Walter pipes up, offering, \"I might have an idea, but only if you stop shitting all over my Adam Martin theories.\" Misty snarls and quickly accuses him of going on \"wild goose chases.\" But Walter's not giving up.\\xa0Soon, Wood's familiar voice is drifting through the old folks' home where Misty works. Amid probing questions about air quality and staff background checks, Walter makes knowing eye contact with Misty. She then finds a note addressed to her in the staff fridge. It appears to be blank, but a flash of a UV light reveals that SICK has found her and is eager to help her in her quest to find Nat. He's even set up an interview with a potential witness, masquerading as an FBI agent. Asking if \"Agent Quigley\" would care to join is just about the most romantic thing Misty might hope for. But this guy is trying to expose her friend for murder. So, their love story has a rocky road ahead.\\xa0Shipping potential aside, who is Walter beyond a rival/love interest for Misty? Could there be a clue in Season 1?\\xa0Is Walter a friend of Adam's?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michael Courtney/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nConsider this: Misty's current focus on the message boards is cracking the case of MIA Nat, a friend for which she'd do anything (including hard drugs). If Walter is Misty's match, as he seems to be, could he be similarly motivated in Adam's case?When Adam died, Shauna knew frustratingly little about him. In Season 1 episode 8, \"Flight of the Bumblebee,\" Shauna confronts Adam over his lies about going to art school at Pratt. From there, Adam proposes a romantic get-to-know-him getaway. \"Look, I've got this friend with a cabin in the woods in the Poconos,\" Adam said, \"Let's go away for the weekend. I'll be an open book.\"\\xa0He doesn't say, \"Let's get a hotel\" or \"Let's take a trip.\" Adam specifically mentions a friend with a cabin. Presumably, he's already asked that friend if he could borrow the place for the weekend. And maybe he even floated why: time alone with a new girlfriend.\\xa0Could Walter be the friend with a cabin? Could it be that this is actually why he knows Adam had a girlfriend and that she might be the key to finding him? Of course, there was a bigger fear that Shauna had about Adam.\\xa0Is Walter a Yellowjackets fanboy?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michael Courtney/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nAs Season 1 episode 9 (\"Doomcoming\") kicks off, Shauna is storming back to Adam's apartment, armed with a handful of glitter and allegations that he's the blackmailer who's been harassing her fellow Yellowjackets. She's convinced he figured out the code to her safe and stole her missing journals from the wilderness. \"The code is the flight number,\" she exclaims. \"It's so fucking dumb. Any fanboy could figure that out.\"\\xa0Yellowjackets fanboys have been mentioned in passing, always disdainfully by the survivors. While Adam is bewildered by these accusations (we later learn Jeff was the blackmailer and borrowed the journals), Shauna discovers that Adam has been hiding a copy of the loathed true crime tell-all Skin in the Game: The Unofficial Story of Flight 2525.From there, Adam says he googled her after they met. \"I saw you were in that plane crash and I was curious,\" he insists. She doesn't believe him. She fears they didn't meet by a chance car collision but that he's a stalker obsessed with the tragic girls of 25 years ago. Adam claims he didn't know her at all before the accident, but he dies before Shauna learns what his deal really is.\\xa0Whether or not they met by happenstance, was Adam a Yellowjackets fanboy? The old book might have been bought easily and recently on eBay, but behind it sits a ragged issue of a gossip magazine, which presumably would be trickier to find. Could it be something he scored from a Yellowjackets message board? Or maybe Adam got it from a friend who has an obsession with crime, conspiracies, and cover-ups.Perhaps Walter had previously owned that trashy true crime book and/or gossip magazine. At the very least, he'd be the right person to turn to for information when Adam started asking questions about Flight 2525. After all, the Yellowjackets girls have been largely living outside the spotlight, but Walter somehow connected AfricanGrey to Misty Quigley's name and workplace. Presumably, he also knows Misty is a Flight 2525 survivor, as that would rank far higher on her search results than her job. So, could he have a fanboy ulterior motive in proposing a meetup?\\xa0Does he suspect Misty is Adam's secret girlfriend?Misty's typically pretty good at sniffing out bullshit. Could her desperate hunger for love blind her when it comes to this cute true crime buff?\\xa0Stay tuned. We'll update as new eps air.Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.",

            "description": "Cannibalism has been quite the trend in TV and film of late. In 2021, Yellowjackets crashed into our lives with the tantalizing and terrifying tale of teens turned could-be cannibals in an untamed wilderness. Then 2022 brought us Netflix's docuseries Dahmer, about the notorious cannibal serial killer. House of Hammer renewed talk of Armie Hammer's flesh-eating fantasies, and Bones and All turned all-consuming teen lust literal with a road trip romance of fine young cannibals.\\xa0Now, 2023 kicked off with The Last of Us, HBO's TV drama set in a post-apocalyptic landscape where brain-infecting fungi transform men into maneaters. And just as that scorching season concluded, Yellowjackets returns with its hotly anticipated second season.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 review: Our favorite messed-up cannibals return \\u2014 with even more bite\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe Last of Us and Yellowjackets have more in common than a plot about a teen girl fighting to survive in a world of cannibals and endless emotional damage. The two series also share an unnerving excuse for the unthinkable, and a few disturbing bits more.\\xa0What do The Last of Us and Yellowjackets have in common?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScott Shepherd as David in \"The Last of Us\" episode 8. \\nCredit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\\n\\n\\nIt all begins with winter. The air is freezing. The game is sparse. The ground is frozen solid. Too solid for digging.\\xa0In episode 8 of The Last of Us, the soft-spoken preacher David (Scott Shepherd) consoles the grieving family of the man Joel (Pedro Pascal) had slain in a previous episode. A sobbing daughter asks when their loving father might be buried. It seems a straightforward question, but it gives David pause. He exchanges glances with his right-hand acolyte (Troy Baker) before declaring, \"The ground is too cold to dig. We'll bury your father in the spring.\"\\xa0It seems a reasonable response. But before the episode's end, we \\u2014 and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) \\u2014 learn the truth behind David's ruse as a peaceful man of God.\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch the 'Yellowjackets' cast absolutely crush Mash Libs\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, on Yellowjackets, the titular team faces a similar crisis in Season 2, episode 2, titled, \"Edible Complex.\" Jackie (Ella Purnell) froze to death months ago, and the earth has not gotten softer since. So, Shauna's (Sophie N\\xe9lisse) has been keeping her deceased bestie in their meat shed, out of sight but very on her mind. Away from the others, Shauna's guilt resurrects Jackie as a smiling, taunting, makeover-demanding imaginary friend. The rest of the team has a vague clue that her coping method has gotten weird, but once they discover that Jackie's been posed and painted like a macabre American Girl doll, Taissa (Jasmin Savoy Brown) decides it's time for proper disposal. \"Shauna, this has to stop,\" Taissa pleads, \"for your own good, and for the good of the baby...We are getting rid of Jackie's two-month-old corpse.\"And what does Shauna say?\\xa0\"We can't even bury her. The ground is frozen solid.\" But they can cremate her. Right? An ear proves a vital clue in Yellowjackets and The Last of Us.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSam Shepherd and Bella Ramsey in \"The Last of Us\" episode 8. \\nCredit: Liane Hentscher/HBO\\n\\n\\nIn both scenarios, it would be an arduous task to dig a proper hole in these frigid conditions. But the digging is not what concerns David or Shauna. It's the meat that might be wasted.While trying to escape from the cage into which David has slung her, Ellie discovers how he's really been providing for his flock. While he insists the stew he's serving to Ellie and his followers is \"deer meat,\" she can plainly see a bloody human ear lying on the floor not far from her cage. Later, Joel will find more gruesome clues to David's Sweeney Todd side.A dismembered ear proves pivotal for Shauna too. It's the bit of Jackie that fell off during a one-sided argument in the shed and made for a secretive snack at the end of Season 1's premiere. So when Taissa proposes burial, we know it's not just Jackie's presence that Shauna will miss. A sly cutaway to the corpse's cut away wrist confirms that Shauna is the first of the Yellowjackets to go cannibal. Like David, she's eager to hide this dining detail. But before long, she won't carry the secret alone.\\xa0Faith blooms in a hopeless place.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Yellowjackets gather in \"Edible Complex.\"\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIs there a dark spirit in the forest that's protecting or possessing the girls? Lottie (Courtney Eaton) and her acolytes believe so. The Antler Queen has steadily been building a religion in the wilderness on blood-infused tea, healing meditation, and the sacrifice of a bear heart. While Yellowjackets plays with what might be paranormal and what might be psychological, it's easy to see how believers might find Jackie's failed funeral pyre a blessing from their wilderness god.Sure, teen girls with no training in cremation might have mucked it up anyway (as they did by setting a live Van aflame in Season 1). But the ominous music and swooping POV-seeming cinematography of the sequence in Season 2, episode 2 suggests something beyond fate fwomped all that snow atop Jackie, preventing her from burning to ash, and instead slow-cooking her as a feast for ravenous followers. When the girls emerge from the cabin to see Jackie laid out like a steaming buffet, a fantasy sequence takes over of them attending a Grecian bacchanal, where every want and whim might be satisfied. Faith and fantasy collided in The Last of Us as well.\\xa0To his followers, David preaches about God and heaven. But to Ellie, he lays down his true faith, declaring the infecting fungus as divine. \"What does Cordryceps do? Is it evil? No,\" David says, \"It's fruitful. It multiplies. It feeds and protects its children, and it secures its future with violence if it must. It loves.\"\\xa0Episode 8 of The Last of Us Season 1 reveals David to be a liar, a cannibal, and a rapist. Yet in his mind, he is a man of faith, devoted to something greater than himself. He uses his beliefs to justify his behavior, to set himself above and apart from those he lies to, assaults, and eats. We don't know how David's path to cannibalism began. But it does seem it might be the same that Lottie and her teammates and acolytes are treading, whether they like it or not.\\xa0They've crossed the line now. They are cannibals, just as the rumors have teased in Season 1. And winter is long and unforgiving. So, it's unlikely Jackie will be the last of their regretful feasts. After all, we know Pit Girl will fall to their needs in what appears to be a ruthless ritual. How will we get there? One bite at a time.\\xa0Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Friday. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.",

            "description": "For the entirety of Yellowjackets Season 1, we had no idea whether Lottie (Courtney Eaton) was alive in the present day. But in the season finale, we finally got confirmation she'd made it through the wilderness.What's Lottie been doing for 25 years since they were finally rescued from the wilderness? Amid Natalie (Juliette Lewis) and Misty's (Christina Ricci) investigations into the suspicious death of Travis (Andres Soto), we find out Lottie (Simone Kessell) was the one responsible for draining his bank account after he died. How is Lottie connected to Travis's death? What's her plan with all of his cash?\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' burning questions we have going into Season 2\\n            \\n\\n\\nWell, in Season 2, we finally catch up with Lottie, who appears to be running a cult \\u2014 sorry, a wellness retreat \\u2014 called Camp Green Pine. What exactly is this place? Who are these purple-clad people? Here's everything we know so far, and we'll be updating this each week with additional details revealed per episode.What happened to Lottie after the Yellowjackets were rescued?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere's Lottie been?\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's return to society was not a smooth one. We get a glimpse into the team's 1998 return in the second season's first episode, as we see the girls herded past one hungry press horde. Since their return, Lottie hasn't uttered a word. She spends her nights silently wandering around her parents' home, so they have her committed to a psychiatric facility. During a session of electroconvulsive therapy, Lottie experiences flashbacks to her visions from the wilderness, and later in her hospital room she uses her \"healing hand\" breathing technique to calm her roommate's anxiety attack, like she did multiple times with Travis in the woods. It seems Lottie may have been inspired by her own confidence in her healing abilities to open a dedicated facility...in the woods.What's the nature of Lottie's wellness retreat?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's gone back into the woods, sort of.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nWhen we first meet Lottie as an adult, she's giving a motivational talk from a minimalist wooden stage in a stunning lakeside location, near a woods. She's orating to an audience completely dressed in shades of purple \\u2014 \"It\\u2019s heliotrope, it\\u2019s not purple,\" Lottie insists. \"We make the dye ourselves from the flowers used to treat wounds.\" \\u2014 while she's dressed in bright orange. I'm just saying, it's the same hue as the followers of Rajneeshpuram, the commune established in rural Oregon in the 1980s that formed the focus of Netflix's Wild Wild Country. Do with that what you will.\"There's only one person who can really give you what you're looking for: You. Your truest, most authentic self. That's why you're here, so I can introduce you,\" Lottie tells her audience. \"Right now there is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self. And there is nothing more painful than hiding that self.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is a version of you that knows exactly who you really are and what you really want. A primal, elemental self.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nBut so far, there's no cult-like activity at Camp Green Pine. Lottie appears to be running a pretty standard holistic mental health retreat for people seeking therapy for trauma or to process negative emotions. In episode 2, when questioned by Natalie, Lottie calmly explains, \"We are not a cult. We are an intentional community turning suffering into strength so we can live as our best selves.\"Chickens roam freely among the camp's curated grounds, residents sit in quiet conversation around the communal bonfire when they're not in their fancy cabins, and late at night, they engage in ritualistic faux burials wearing animal masks and white robes \\u2014 or sometimes nothing at all. \"A therapeutic treatment, one of many we offer here,\" Lottie explains in episode 2. Who knows if there's a quiz night? But it's not all Goopy woo-woo wellness vibes all the time, as Lottie momentarily loses her chill over something so small as a health shake ingredient. When her associate Lisa (Nicole Maines) brings her daily shake, she quietly reprimands her. \"I smell butterscotch, did you put maca root in here? Hmm. I asked for ashwagandha. I want my focus increased, not my libido.\" Feigning she's fine with it as Natalie is present, Lottie then promptly throws her shake, in a reusable cup with reusable straw, in the garbage.But there's one thing at Camp Green Pine it appears Lottie brought back from the woods: that dreaded symbol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie seems to have borrowed a little somethin' from the wilderness.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nThe seemingly apotropaic icon we've seen all series immediately comes into play in episode 1, when Natalie notices it being worn as a pendant by Lisa: \"That thing around your neck tells me all I need to know.\"Why did Lottie's group kidnap Natalie?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a gentle introduction.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nEssentially, Lottie's community members kidnapped Natalie to save her life. But they didn't save her...gently. In the first season's finale, a group of purple-clad people burst into Natalie's hotel room just as she's about to kill herself, dragging her into a van marked with the symbol from the wilderness. In Season 2's first episode, Natalie is being held captive in a wooden cabin, where she's restrained by the wrists. Why does Lottie have bed cuffs installed in her accommodation? \"We were afraid you were going to hurt yourself,\" says Lisa, who has been assigned to supervise Natalie. It appears to be the type of physical restraint used in psychiatric facilities, and as Natalie realises, it's not a regular practice residents like Lisa are used to at all. But Camp Green Pine's real \"Hotel California\" energy comes into play when Natalie violently escapes her cabin cell, as followers in purple pursue her through the woodsy darkness, calling out, \"Hey, get back here!\" Not exactly welcoming, huh?How did Lottie's cult begin in the wilderness?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have a bad feeling about this place.\"\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's journey toward becoming the Yellowjackets' spiritual leader in the wilderness runs a steady pace in Season 1, but hasn't quite been defined yet in Season 2. Though Lottie's initial connection to spirituality seems loose in Season 1, her increasingly prominent \"visions\" define her experience in the wilderness, from her French-speaking outburst during the attic seance to Jackie finding her standing in the lake in her PJs, not to mention her underwater premonition of Laura Lee's explosive death. Lottie is the first Yellowjacket to find one of the series' signature spooky symbols carved into a tree, and she dons a crown of antlers in the \"Doomcoming\" episode, all but confirming she's the Antler Queen from the Season 1's opening scene of ritualistic cannibalism.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nTripping on Misty's mushrooms, Lottie easily leads several fellow Yellowjackets into a bacchanal of screaming, howling girls who pursue Travis for their own hedonistic, violent, and possibly sacrificial means. During their psychedelic journey, Lottie says aloud, \"We won't be hungry much longer.\" The next day, she confronts a bear that wanders near their cabin and seemingly kneels before her so she can kill it. This moment seems to solidify her divine association to several followers, including Van and Misty, who join her for a ritualistic offering of the bear's heart to an altar. \"Shed blood, my beautiful friends, and let the darkness set us free,\" Lottie declares. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeva4get.\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nDuring their time in the woods, Lottie constantly talks about this darkness in the wilderness \"being in all of you.\" During the seance scene, she repeats the words, \"It wants\\u2026It wants\\u2026It wants\\u2026hungry,\" before speaking in French about something wanting blood and declaring, \"You must spill blood or else.\"By Season 2's first episode, Lottie's not exactly running nightly bloodbath ceremonies, but she has established a ritual of giving Travis and Natalie tea she's pricked her finger and bled into before each hunt, then drawing the symbol on the window to keep them safe.Lottie's gift of foresight has a longer history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Kimberley French/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nLottie's experiences with visions run deeper than her time in the wilderness. In Season 1, the series takes us back into Lottie's childhood, when she screams in terror from the back seat of her parents' car right before a crash occurs \\u2014 one that would have most certainly involved their car had she not screamed, causing her dad to brake. Dismissing the possibility of Lottie's clairvoyance, her parents decide to send her to a psychiatrist, where she's prescribed an ambiguous medication for her mental health. In the wilderness, Lottie takes her last remaining pill, and the visions begin.Why did Lottie take Travis's money?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourtney Eaton as Lottie and Kevin Alves as Travis.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nIt's confirmed in the season finale that Lottie was the one to drain Travis's bank account after he died, but did she use the money to fund her retreat? Considering Lottie's establishment is well up and running, it seems unlikely she used the money for this purpose. What was Travis and Lottie's relationship like after they left the wilderness though? Beyond that whole almost-sacrificial moment (whoops!), Travis seems to have found a spiritual connection with Lottie during her anxiety-quelling breathing practices, and Lottie flashes into Travis' mind during sex with Natalie. Plus, Lottie has been insistent that Javi, his missing brother, is alive in the woods, despite Nat's criticism of this \"false hope.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie says Travis gave her instructions to access his bank accounts.\\nCredit: Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME\\n\\n\\nWhen grown-up Natalie confronts Lottie in episode 1, she's pretty damn pissed, though Lottie claims to have a message for her from Travis. In episode 2, this turns out to be the note Travis wrote and left in his house, reading \"Tell Nat she was right.\" Lottie tells Nat the story of Travis' death as accidental in his quest to somehow communicate with the darkness from the wilderness. Driving to his house after a worrying call, Lottie finds Travis panicking, saying, \"When Van almost died, when you did, you both said you saw something. The only way to confront the darkness to find out what it wants is to get as close to death as possible.\" Lottie soothes Travis, they both fall asleep, and in the night Travis drives to the ranch where he works, apparently leaving Lottie instructions of how to get into his bank account. Lottie somehow guesses he's gone to the ranch, finds him in the barn, and says, \"He had lit candles around him in the shape of the symbol.\" She helps Travis in his dangerous quest, but it goes wrong and he dies by suicide. Lottie leaves one part of out of her story: she sees Laura Lee's ghost in the barn.\"I didn't kill him, Nat. I was trying to save him,\" Lottie says. So, is Lottie telling the truth about what happened to Travis? Did she really try to help him? Was it an accident? Why didn't Lottie try other ways to save Travis? Does it have anything to do with Camp Green Pine? As Natalie says, \"I know there's something you're not telling me.\"There's plenty more ahead \\u2014 we'll keep you updated every week on all things Lottie.

It's one of four criminal investigations currently looking into the former president's activities \\u2014 alongside two from the DoJ regarding the Jan. 6 insurrection and mishandling of classified documents, and one relating to election interference in Fulton County, Georgia \\u2014 but it's the first to result in actual charges against Trump himself.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Donald Trump is melting down on Truth Social over his indictment\\n            \\n\\n\\nWatchers in both Trump's camp and the media more broadly had been expecting the indictment as early as last Tuesday, so the political wits and meme dealers of Twitter had some time to prep their gags.

            "description": "The 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has officially been \"INDICATED.\"Well, at least that's what he said in a rant on his social media platform, Truth Social. What Trump really means is that he's been \"indicted.\" On Thursday, March 30, 2023 a New York grand jury voted to indict the former president. The charges have not been unsealed at this time. Trump has been under investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office for his alleged involvement in a \"hush money payment scheme\" involving adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaigns. Trump has been ranting about a potential indictment on Truth Social for weeks after rumors spread regarding an investigation into the alleged scheme and subsequent cover-up. So, when the news of the indictment came through, it was only a matter of time before the former president delivered with some more posts.\"This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history,\" Trump opened with his first Truth Social post of the evening, in an attached screenshot of his usual press release statements.Trump goes on to mention the opening of his first presidential campaign when he \"came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower.\" He attacks Manhattan DA Bragg and predicts that the \"Witch-Hunt\" will backfire on Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election.He then followed up the press release with a more classic Donald Trump-esque social media post where he misspells the word \"indicted.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump rants about being \"indicated\" on Truth Social.\\nCredit: Mashable Screenshot\\n\\n\\n\"These Thugs and Radical Left Monsters have just INDICATED the 45th President of the United States of America...\" Trump posted. \"THIS IS AN ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY THE LIKES OF WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE.\"\"SO SAD!\" he continued.The news of his indictment comes ones day after Trump predicted in a Truth Social post that he would not be indicted.\"I HAVE GAINED SUCH RESPECT FOR THIS GRAND JURY, & PERHAPS EVEN THE GRAND JURY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE,\" he posted on March 29. \"THE EVIDENCE IS SO OVERWHELMING IN MY FAVOR, & SO RIDICULOUSLY BAD FOR THE HIGHLY PARTISAN & HATEFUL DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THAT THE GRAND JURY IS SAYING, HOLD ON, WE ARE NOT A RUBBER STAMP, WHICH MOST GRAND JURIES ARE BRANDED AS BEING, WE ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE AGAINST A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OR AGAINST LARGE NUMBERS OF LEGAL SCHOLARS ALL SAYING THERE IS NO CASE HERE. DROP THIS SICK WITCH HUNT, NOW!\"With his indictment, Donald Trump makes history as the first former president to face criminal charges.Read Donald Trump's press release response in fullThis is the statement Trump issued after his indictment was announced:This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history. From the time I came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower, and even before I was sworn in as your President of the United States, the Radical Left Democrats the enemy of the hard-working men and women c this Country have been engaged in a Witch-Hunt to destroy the Make America Great Again movement. You remember it just like I do: Russia, Russia, Russia; the Mueller Hoax;Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine; Impeachment Hoax 1; Impeachment Hoax 2; the illegal and unconstitutional Mar-a-Lago raid; and now this. \\u201cThe Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to \\u2019Get Trump; but now they\\u2019ve done the unthinkable indicting a completely innocent person in an act blatant Election Interference. \\u201cNever before in our Nation\\u2019s history has this been done. The Democrats have cheated countless times over the decades, including spying on my campaign, but weaponizing our justice system to punish a political opponent, who just so happens to be a President of the United States and by far the leading Republican candidate for President, has never happened before. Ever.\"Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who was hand-picked and funded by George Soros, is a disgrace. Rather than stopping the unprecedented crime wave taking over New York City, he\\u2019s doing Joe Biden\\u2019s dirty work, ignoring the murders and burglaries and assaults he should be focused on. This is how Bragg spends his time!I believe this Witch-Hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden. The American people realize exactly what the Radical Left Democrats are doing here. Everyone can see it. So our Movement, and our Party united and strong will first defeat Alvin Bragg, and then we will defeat Joe Biden, are going to throw every last one of these Crooked Democrats out of office so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\\u201d",

            "title": "'Quordle' today: Here are the answers and hints for March 31",
            "description": "If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?One word has a double letter.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?C, T, S, and P.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

Now none of that is happening.Citing two anonymous sources inside E3\\u2019s parent organization, the Entertainment Software Association, IGN reported the cancelation on Thursday afternoon. IGN\\u2019s report was then confirmed when the ESA released a public statement credited to Kyle Marsden-Kish, global vice president of gaming at ReedPop:\"This was a difficult decision because of all the effort we and our partners put toward making this event happen, but we had to do what\\u2019s right for the industry and what\\u2019s right for E3.

            "title": "Daniel Radcliffe teams up with The Trevor Project to amplify LGBTQ youth voices",
            "description": "With help from acclaimed actor Daniel Radcliffe, LGBTQ youth organization The Trevor Project is uplifting the perspectives of trans and nonbinary youth amid a national conversation on their identities and rights.Launched on March 31 \\u2014 recognized as Transgender Day of Visibility \\u2014 the new \\u201cSharing Space\\u201d video series aims to provide a platform for LGBTQ youth to discuss topics impacting their lives, with support from a guest moderator. The first episode is hosted by Radcliffe, who facilitates conversation with six transgender and nonbinary young people about their experiences, the feeling of gender euphoria, self-discovery, and what it means to be a genuine ally to trans people.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            School district bans 'Rainbowland' Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton duet as 'controversial'\\n            \\n\\n\\n\"There are some people in this world not trying to engage with this conversation in any kind of good faith,\" Radcliffe says to the group. \"I think a lot of the time it's just because people don't know a young, trans person, so there's just this theoretical idea about this in their heads.\"\"Even if you may think you don't know someone who is queer or trans,\" one of the roundtable speakers replies, \"at some point you will.\"The actor has a long history with The Trevor Project, the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ young people. Radcliffe was honored in 2011 with a Trevor Hero Award and later starring in a 2012 PSA about The Trevor Project's free services. Since then, Radcliffe has continued to participate in LGBTQ advocacy and has spoken out against rising transphobia in his industry, including inflammatory statements by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling.\\xa0In 2020, Radcliffe published an open letter on The Trevor Project website responding to Rowling's anti-trans comments, writing, \"Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either [Rowling] or I.\"\\xa0The \"Sharing Space\" series launch comes at a time when anti-LGBTQ legislation is gaining traction nationwide. The American Civil Liberties Union currently is tracking 435 anti-LGBTQ bills across the U.S., many of which target trans and gender non-conforming youth, specifically. On March 29, Kentucky made law one of the most restrictive pieces of legislation yet proposed.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAccording to a January poll by The Trevor Project, 86 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth reported that debates around anti-trans bills have negatively impacted their mental health. Of those polled, 45 percent said they've faced increased cyberbullying, and a third said they no longer felt safe seeking out medical support when sick or injured. Researchers and advocacy organizations like The Trevor Project have shown that transgender and nonbinary youth face disproportionately high rates of suicide risk and poor mental health due to anti-trans mistreatment they experience.\\xa0Last month, the organization also launched the \"Learn with Love\" video series, which invited young trans people to share their journeys toward acceptance alongside family members who had complicated reactions to their coming out.\\xa0\"It was an absolute privilege to get to meet and listen to this incredible group of young people,\" Radcliffe said in an official statement for the new series. \"At the end of the day, if you're going to talk about trans kids, it might be useful to actually listen to trans kids.\"\"Sharing Space\" seeks to provide a more positive understanding of the trans experience, The Trevor Project explains. \"LGBTQ young people, particularly transgender and nonbinary youth, are routinely forced to stand by and watch adults debate their very existence and life experiences,\" wrote Megan Stowe, vice president of brand and content at The Trevor Project, in the series announcement. \"Our society has created boxes that young people are expected to fit into, when we should be giving them the space and autonomy to figure out who they are on their own.\"Watch the first episode in full on The Trevor Project YouTube channel, and tune in throughout the year for new episodes featuring different themes, hosts, and roundtable members.\\xa0If you're feeling suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, please talk to somebody.

            "title": "Why chilling out to your favorite shows can actually stress you out more",
            "description": "Let\\u2019s face it. We can\\u2019t get enough entertainment content. Whether we're just waiting in line somewhere or plopping down on the sofa to chill out, we watch zombie shows, animated series, gritty dramas or whatever it is that gets us going. Streaming our favorite content is good, entertaining fun, no doubt \\u2014 but according to the latest \"While You Were Streaming\" report from Truth Initiative, a whopping 60 percent of the 15 most popular TV shows among 15 to 24-year-olds contained depictions of tobacco use in 2021, exposing 25 million young people to smoking and vaping imagery that puts them at risk for nicotine addiction.\\xa0Research shows high exposure to on-screen tobacco imagery \\u2014 and the glamorization of it \\u2014 poses a serious public health threat to young people, making them three times more likely to start vaping nicotine in the first place. With these products being shown all around us, we should be very concerned given that the CDC reported over 2.5 million middle school and high school students were using e-cigarettes in 2022 with 46 percent of high school students who vape nicotine doing so almost daily. Images have an influence and as it turns out the content we consume to unwind and de-stress the day away may be having detrimental effects on mental health.The link between nicotine and mental healthWhile the tobacco industry has advertised its products as stress relievers for decades, truth \\u2014\\xa0the national youth smoking, vaping, and nicotine prevention and education campaign from Truth Initiative \\u2014\\xa0launched a campaign last year to expose the connection between vaping nicotine and mental health. truth even created a fake vape company called Depression Stick! to make their point clearer. The most recent effort from truth, called Breath of Stress Air, further debunks the myth that vaping is a stress reliever. The campaign's ASMR-styled animations bring attention to not only how the tobacco industry is making money off the backs of young people, but how it's messing with their heads. Research shows that nicotine can amplify feelings of anxiety and depression and increase stress levels.\\xa0In case you need help connecting the dots between vaping and mental health, here's a quick rundown: Within minutes of using a nicotine vape, you might feel less anxious. That's because nicotine is stimulating your brain's release of dopamine, a naturally occurring chemical messenger that's part of your body's rewards system \\u2014 but the good feelings don't last long. The dopamine wears off fast and the more you vape nicotine, the more you condition your body to crave the release of dopamine from nicotine. Skip vaping for a few hours and you might start spiraling. A quick vape hit might level you out, but skip another few hours and you're back to spiraling. Essentially, vaping nicotine can turn fresh air into stress air.Tools to help you quit and stay quitThe human brain is still developing until around the age of 25, making young people more susceptible to nicotine addiction. The trick is to be aware of the facts, and truth has loads of resources, including their This is Quitting program, to give you tips, strategies, and inspiration to live vape-free. Having science-backed tools at your disposal for quitting is one way that you're more likely to see success.\\xa0Set a date and find replacement activities\\xa0Every journey begins with a single step and committing to quit is priority number one for many people. It's also a good idea to plan activities that you can turn to when urges hit, like going for a run, practicing a mindfulness technique, or taking your pup to the park.\\xa0Seek out support\\xa0You're not alone in quitting and you don't have to do it solo. Over 560,000 young people have enrolled in This is Quitting, a free text-message quit-vaping program from truth. You can text \"DITCHVAPE\" to 88709 and get immediate help to quit. You\\u2019ll receive messages from peers and quitting experts, and you can also chat 1:1 through This is Quitting\\u2019s partnership with Crisis Text Line.\\xa0 Stories from other \"Quitters\" are also easy to access for more inspiration.\\xa0Trade 'stress air' for fresh air\\xa0Breathing is a proven method to reduce anxiety and can help curb cravings. This is Quitting and Breathwrk have partnered to create breathing exercises to help young people reach their quitting goals. Users who used the Breathwrk breathing exercises were 30 percent more likely to succeed in completing the This is Quitting program, so it's worth checking out.Celebrate your accomplishmentsYour first vape-free day is as much of a victory as your first vape-free month. Be sure to mark your progress and celebrate it. Maybe take yourself out for gelato after one week, nab those sneakers you've been eyeballing after one month, and keep the self-love rolling.\\xa0Quitting nicotine is no easy feat, especially when we see smoking and vaping depicted and even glamorized in top-watched shows, music videos, and even on the big screen. Groups like Truth Initiative are working with and calling for entertainment companies, producers, creatives, and celebrities to keep tobacco images off-screen. And also, there are plenty of tools \\u2014 like those from truth \\u2014 to help young people quit and stay nicotine-free, to ultimately help take those first steps, stay on track, and play a leading role in changing the picture, both on-screen and in person.",

            "description": "On Thursday, the Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP), an advocacy nonprofit, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) targeting OpenAI. The complaint argues that the company's latest large language model, GPT-4, which can be used to power ChatGPT, is in violation of FTC rules against deception and unfairness. This comes on the heels of an open letter signed by major figures in AI, including Elon Musk, which called for a six-month pause on the training of systems more powerful than GPT-4.The complaint asks the Commission \"to initiate an investigation into OpenAI and find that the commercial release of GPT-4 violates Section 5 of the FTC Act.\" This section, the complaint explains, provides guidance about AI and outlines the \"emerging norms for the governance of AI that the United States government has formally endorsed.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Oh great, Microsoft's Bing AI chatbot is getting more ads\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhat's so scary about GPT-4, according to this complaint? It is allegedly \"biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety,\" The complaint also says that GPT-4 makes unproven claims and is not sufficiently tested. The CAIDP also points out \\u2014 using quotes from past reports written by OpenAI itself \\u2014 that OpenAI knows about the potential to bring about, or worsen, \"disinformation and influence operations,\" and that the company has expressed concerns about \"proliferation of conventional and unconventional weapons\" thanks in part to AI. OpenAI has also, the complaint notes, warned the public that AI systems could \"reinforce entire ideologies, worldviews, truths and untruths, and to cement them or lock them in, foreclosing future contestation, reflection, and improvement.\" The complaint also rips into OpenAI for apparently not conducting safety checks aimed at protecting children during GPT-4's testing period. And it quotes Ursula Pachl, Deputy Director of the European Consumer Organization (BEUC) who said, \"public authorities must reassert control over [AI algorithms] if a company doesn't take remedial action.\" By quoting Pachl, the CAIDP is clearly invoking \\u2014 if not directly calling for \\u2014 major government moves aimed at regulating AI. European regulators are already weighing a much more heavy-handed, and rules-based approach to this technology. And this comes as companies are looking to make money in the generative AI space. Microsoft Bing's GPT-4-powered chatbot, for instance, is now generating ad revenue. Such companies are no doubt eagerly awaiting the FTC's response. ",

            "description": "Twitter has officially announced its brand new API plans for developers. And looking over the details, it's clear Elon Musk sees indie developers as acceptable losses in Twitter's latest cash grab.Unfortunately but not unexpectedly, a slew of indie developers have already announced they'd have to shut down their Twitter-based apps due to the new pricing. After all, how many indie developers can afford $42,000 per month?\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the official Twitter Developer account shared details regarding pricing of its new API plan. The API basically provides third-party applications and developers with access to the social media platform's data and features. The company also emailed details of the new AI plan to developers.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAccording to Twitter, free access to the API \\u200bwill only allow developers to write 1,500 tweets per month. The new free tier of the API no longer includes the ability for developers to access tweets, only create them.To compare, Twitter's old free plan, called \"Elevated,\" currently allows developers to access 2 million tweets per month.Twitter offers two plans at wildly different price pointsAs for the paid plan, there is one tier called Basic, which Twitter classifies as being for hobbyists or students. This plan costs $100 per month and only allows access to 10,000 tweets per month. One can also write 50,000 tweets per month with this plan.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nAgain, this new paid plan is much less than the previous free plan's limits. Most apps using the Twitter API that have a few regular users are going to exceed these limits rather quickly, if they aren't already.So, what's the next step up? The Enterprise plans, which Mashable previously reported on, which start at $42,000 per month.That's right. There's currently no announced plan between the $100 per month Basic tier and the $42,000 per month starting price for the Enterprise plans. As of now, if you outgrow the $100 plan, you'll need to upgrade to the $42,000 per month plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe email from Twitter sent to developers breaking down the subscription options for Twitter's new API plans.\\nCredit: Mashable Screenshot\\n\\n\\nElon Musk says the new API pricing is being implemented to kill off the bots, but looking at the reaction on Twitter, it's more like armageddon for any indie developer who runs actually useful Twitter apps. Numerous developers have already announced that the new API pricing structure basically forces them to shut down their Twitter-based apps.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"With new Twitter API prices I'm sad to announce the end of TwittExplorer \\U0001f622,\" tweeted @Pauline_Cx.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"Updated my Twitter bio to reflect current events,\" tweeted @adamlyttleapps, alongside a screenshot of his new Twitter bio indicating he will no longer be working on his TopFollowers.io Twitter app.Many apps will change or disappear completelyDevelopers running apps that use the Twitter API, but are not entirely based on it, also announced some major changes.\"This is sad \\U0001f613,\" tweeted @SimonHoiberg, who runs a social media management app called FeedHive. \"To all of our Twitter users, I apologize for the inconvenience! $42,000/month is simply beyond what we consider financially viable or reasonable to pay.\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Half of Twitter Blue subscribers have less than 1,000 followers\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe FeedHive founder followed up his post with a tweet from his app's official Twitter profile announcing that they would have to remove Twitter from the social media platforms that can be managed via its app.As of Thursday afternoon, one Slack community for Twitter app developers to discuss these changes already ballooned to more than 700 members. At publishing time, only five app developers said they could afford to stay open under Twitter's planned API changes.Killing off the third-party app ecosystem is a shortsighted move from Musk and company. Many of these apps encourage more usage of the Twitter platform by making it easier for users to create more content.\\xa0Some apps like @remotejoeclark's Twitter HP, motivated users to use Twitter more by allowing them to better track their analytics on the platform. Unfortunately, Twitter's new API pricing plan has now killed his app.And unlike some others who are waiting to see what happens as Twitter closes the old API access over the next 30 days, @remotejoeclark was forced to shut down his app and issue refunds to customers immediately. Why? Because he upgraded to the new Basic API plan as soon as he could and Twitter immediately locked him out because the app already had exceeded that month's tweet allotment under the prior API offering. At that point, he already had to make a choice: pay $42,000 or close up shop.How much do indie developers earn?Many indie developers don't make all that much from their apps. On Twitter, you'll often find developers trying to hit a goal of making $1,000, $2,000, $5,000, or maybe even $10,000 per month from their project in the hopes of being able to make it a self-sustaining full-time job. At $42,000, Twitter is not just making those goals unattainable for indie developers, it's also making its chances at a profitable future more difficult too. By killing the very tools that make people want to use the platform.\\xa0Third-party developers will now just move on to other platforms that are more friendly to their needs. And while there, they'll create the tools that users want, making Twitter's social media competitors more popular.\\xa0",

            "title": "5 hidden clues in the 'Yellowjackets' Season 2 opening credits",
            "description": "The Yellowjackets opening credits are worth watching again and again, and not just because they're unskippably catchy, thanks to Anna Waronker and Craig Wedren's \"No Return.\"As you might have already noticed, hidden among the glitching VHS effects and rapidly edited visuals are a few rogue frames from the second season that are different to the Season 1 opening credits \\u2014 including some brief shots that might hold clues about what's to come.We've combed through the Season 2 opening credits frame by frame, worked out what's there that wasn't there before, and then filtered out the most interesting moments...\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Yellowjackets' Season 2 preview shows a glimpse of Shauna's birth scene\\n            \\n\\n\\n1. The strange symbol marked on a map (27 seconds in).Everybody's favourite spooky symbol \\u2014 you know, the little stick figure with the slash through it that appears carved into trees in the woods and the cabin's attic floor, and that grown-up Misty (Christina Ricci), Taissa (Tawny Cypress), and Natalie (Juliette Lewis) are sent on postcards in Season 1 \\u2014 appears yet again in the Season 2 opening credits. Only this time it appears to have been plotted on a map.Is it possible the girls have worked out some strange pattern in the wilderness? Are we going to finally find out what the weird little thing means? 2. Misty licking blood off her fingers (38 seconds in).The ghost of cannibalism has been hanging over the show since the opening \"Pit Girl\" scene of the very first episode \\u2014 and judging by this shot of young Misty (Samantha Hanratty), which shows her face covered in what looks like blood as she licks her fingers clean, it's not going to be long before it makes a comeback.The only caveat? Yellowjackets isn't short on hallucinations and dream sequences, so it's always possible this is some kind of nightmare rather as opposed to real life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLottie's weird wilderness cult looks like it's only going to get bigger.\\nCredit: Showtime\\n\\n\\n3. Someone cutting their palm with a knife (52 seconds in).Yep, it looks like the weird cult-like behaviour that's forming around Lottie (Courtney Eaton) is only going to get worse. In Season 2, episode 1, we see her blessing Natalie (Sophie Thatcher) and Travis (Kevin Alves) before their daily search for Javi (Luciano Leroux) by pricking her finger and dripping blood into their tea. Based on the shot of someone unidentified cutting their palm in the opening credits, these kind of blood offerings are likely to become more extreme.4. A goat tied up in the woods with a rope (61 seconds in).A goat? Tied up in the woods? What exactly is going on here, then? It's impossible to know for sure, but we assume this shot comes from the wilderness timeline, given the location. If that's the case, though, then it raises its own set of questions. How do the girls stumble across a goat in the woods? Where does it come from? And are they keeping it or planning to use it as bait to catch another bear?\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch the 'Yellowjackets' cast absolutely crush Mash Libs\\n\\n\\n\\n5. The girls charging through the wilderness with weapons (78 seconds in).It's not a question of if the Yellowjackets are going to descend into ritualistic violence and start killing each other, it's a question of when. And judging by the brief shot in the credits of the team charging through the snowy wilderness, weapons raised, it looks like this moment might come sooner rather than later.Could they be hunting an animal? It's possible. But whatever they're chasing is clearly not that much quicker than them, which leads us to think their prey might very well be human.Yellowjackets Season 2 is streaming on Showtime, with new episodes streaming weekly on Fridays. Episodes also air every Sunday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET.",

From now until 11:59pm AEDT on Sunday, April 2, you'll find some of the biggest discount prices available on Amazon all year, rivalled only by Amazon Prime Day in June/July, and Black Friday in November. Thankfully, you don't need to wait another three or six months to pick up that high-ticket gadget you've been chasing on the cheap; you can do it right now! If you enjoy trawling through hundreds (even thousands) of deals, be sure to check out the official Big Smile Sale page on the Amazon Australia store. Otherwise, we've done the hard work for you, and listed the top deals we've seen across a range of product categories, including robot vacuums, laptops, headphones and speakers and more. Happy hunting!What is the Big Smile Sale?The Big Smile Sale is an Amazon-exclusive sale that takes place twice a year in Australia, across all categories, but with a huge amount of tech products available. The only other major Amazon sale is, of course, Amazon Prime Day (which normally goes down around June or July). While Prime Day is a bit bigger and features more deals, it is only available to Prime Members in Australia. Meanwhile, you don't need an Amazon Prime membership to access the Big Smile deals, though it may be beneficial to get one, as they come with a 30-day free trial and include free shipping on a huge range of the available Big Smile products. Learn more about Prime memberships in Australia here. When is the Big Smile Sale?Amazon's first Big Smile Sales went down in 2022, and took place in Autumn and Spring, respectively. The first 2023 event kicked off suddenly at midday on March 27 (with no prior warning), and runs for a week, until 11:59pm AEDT on April 2. While there is no word yet on the dates for the second 2023 Big Smile event, it's likely to also have similar timing, so should take place some time this Spring. What are the best items to buy during the Big Smile Sale?The sale covers all of Amazon's categories, but you can expect the biggest discounts (from a dollars perspective) on big-ticket tech items like robot vacuums, laptops, hi-fi, headphones and more. The timing of the current Autumn event is just in time for Mother's Day 2023, so be sure to check out some cool 'high-tech' gadgets for mum. There are, of course, also some great prices to be found on beauty, fashion and apparel, so it's worth having a scroll down the official brand deals listed above, such as Calvin Klein and Nike. Finally, not all of the Big Smile deals are listed on the official Big Smile page on the Amazon store. However, there are literally thousands of deals across Amazon this week. If you're after a specific item, we would recommend simply searching for it on main Amazon storefront, as you may get lucky and snag it for a discount price. ",

            "title": "Why we enjoy being humiliated during sex",
            "description": "You\\u2019re on a leash, on the floor, being told you\\u2019re a disgusting animal. Your partner puts a high heeled shoe up to your face and demands you kiss their foot.\\xa0You do it.\\xa0They bring out a paddle and give you a spanking. They spit on you. You endure it. You\\u2019ve never been more turned on in your life.\\xa0Welcome to the world of erotic humiliation play. You\\u2019re going to have so much fun here.Being humiliated in non-sexual scenarios is a huge driving force behind a lot of our anxieties. We loathe being embarrassed or made to feel small. It fucking sucks.\\xa0But in sex, it can feel like the opposite. BDSM often is a safe place to work through and play with our biggest fears and anxieties. It\\u2019s a way to take back a bit of control in a world that can feel like pure chaos. Humiliation during sex is at its core, \"eroticizing or getting pleasure from words or activities that elicit feelings of embarrassment, shame, or humiliation,\" says Zachary Zane, author of Boyslut: A Memoir and Manifesto, and sex expert for Momentum Intimacy. \"You get a rush response when you're called certain names or do [certain things], and people enjoy that heightened sensation in a sexual context.\"\\xa0Want more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable's new weekly After Dark newsletter.Remember in Succession when Gerri Kellman (J. Smith-Cameron) \\u2014 mommy, btw \\u2014  went off on one to Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) about what a disgusting little pig he was while he jerked off in the bathroom? He was massively into being humiliated. It was the thing that was getting him off. The more horrible the things she said, the more into it he became. Arguably one of the hottest scenes in modern television history, if you\\u2019re into that kind of thing.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Succession's 'ludicrously capacious bag' becomes ludicrously capacious meme\\n            \\n\\n\\nMaking shame sexy. Who knew?If you\\u2019re feeling a bit ~titillated~, you\\u2019re certainly in good company. This practice is huge in the kink world. In a study of cis-gendered women affiliated with the kink community, almost 43 percent enjoyed verbal abuse or humiliation and almost 26 percent enjoyed humiliating their partner in the same way. Erotic humiliation can be enjoyed by anyone, of any gender, of any sexual orientation.Let\\u2019s explore what humiliation really is in BDSM, why people are so wild about it, and how to practice it safely (if you\\u2019re down to clown).What humiliation play is in a kink context.Humiliation play is incorporating humiliation into your sexual and/or BDSM practice. \"It is a form of consensual psychological humiliation that can be physical, verbal, and emotional,\" explains Dr. Lee Phillips, a psychotherapist and certified sex and couples therapist. \"It is common in submissive/dominant relationships and it falls under the BDSM umbrella of sadomasochism.\"You literally become sexually aroused by being degraded.OK, a quick refresher on what BDSM is \\u2014 because if we don\\u2019t understand this aspect, humiliation play makes zero sense. BDSM stands for Bondage, Discipline/Dominance, Submission, Masochism. This kind of play hinges on consensual powerplay wherein the Dominant partner leads and the submissive partner follows.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            A beginner's guide to understanding Dom/sub dynamics\\n            \\n\\n\\nIn the context of erotic humiliation, the powerplay is focused on degradation. The Dom humiliates the sub in a safe and consensual way. \"Humiliation-play can take place in the bedroom during sex, but sex does not have to be incorporated,\" Philips says. \"For example, crawling on your hands and knees with something in your mouth [and] bringing it to your Dom as they talk down to you is seen as humiliation-play.\"Humiliation can be a part of all BDSM dynamics. It\\u2019s about the intention. It\\u2019s an act within the play itself. It may be present in:Psychological kink playSuch as verbal insults/degrading languagePunishments and painplaySuch as spankings, being tied up, slapped, or spit on.Role playSuch as classic Dom/sub leather dynamics, Human/animal play, Caregiver/little (Daddy/little girl, Mommy/little boy etc.)Why do people crave humiliation during sex?We\\u2019re into humiliation during sex for many reasons. Because humans are hella complicated.Shameful messages around sex.\"We learn about sex in a way that links sexuality with shame. Whether told directly or absorbed indirectly through culture, most of us hear far more about who and what we \\u2018shouldn\\u2019t\\u2019 do, the risks involved, and the potential damage (real or imagined) our sexual behaviors may cause,\" explains Sarah Melancon, Ph.D, a sociologist, clinical sexologist, and resident expert at The Sex Toy Collective.\\n    We learn about sex in a way that links sexuality with shame.\\n    \\nDespite this negative messaging, we still have sexual feelings. We\\u2019re human, after all. When our natural feelings are coupled with the messaging that sex is wrong and shameful, it can \"cause us to purposefully bring feelings of shame or embarrassment to the surface and [this] can heighten arousal for many,\" Melancon says.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to explore a praise kink\\n            \\n\\n\\nOf course, we also have deeply personal insecurities that play into this. For example, if you\\u2019re insecure about your penis size, you may enjoy small-penis humiliation play. Your turn-on comes from your shame being eroticized.\\xa0Giving up control.Additionally, embracing erotic humiliation can be an act of deep surrender for the submissive partner, says Julieta Chiaramonte, a kink instructor and sex expert. Completely giving your power over to a Dom is a big part of being fully immersed in powerplay.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best sex toys for masturbation\\n            \\n\\n\\nOften, humiliation play is a way to let go of control, when your real life demands otherwise. \"This is why usually very high-level CEOs or dominant people in their normal life may love being called unworthy and walking like a dog on a leash at night,\" Chiaramonte says. \"It\\u2019s relaxing, it\\u2019s taboo, and it\\u2019s hot to experiment in the shadow of humanity.\"Building intimacy.Ironically, being humiliated during sex can actually be used to deepen your bond with your partner. \"You're very vulnerable when being humiliated,\" Zane says. To engage in such a highly emotive form of play suggests a relationship that is deeply steeped in trust.Safety and consent are key to safe play.As with all sexual play, safety and consent are absolutely essential to playing in an ethical and enjoyable way. Remember, just because the play is centered around degradation doesn\\u2019t mean we\\u2019re looking to harm one another. Enthusiastic consent is a must. If it isn\\u2019t a hell yeah, it\\u2019s a hell no. \\n    If it isn\\u2019t a hell yeah, it\\u2019s a hell no. \\n\\n    \\nChiaramonte suggests having a conversation with your partner in 3 steps. This should be done in a neutral, non-sexual space before play begins.\\xa0Here is my desire: \"I would love to try some humiliation play, let me tell you more about it.\"This is why I desire it: \"I think it would be really hot to be called X, Y, Z, and maybe wear a leash. This makes me feel super dominated.\"This is why I would love to try it with you: \"I really trust you, enjoy our intimacy, and think it would be fun to experiment with this. How do you feel about it?\"\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            KinkTok is rife with misinformation. Here's why that's dangerous.\\n            \\n\\n\\nHumiliation play looks different for everyone. \"Humiliation-play is based on your own perceptions and experiences,\" Philips says. You want to be clear on what you want and how you want it, so that everyone has the opportunity to play in a way that feels safe and pleasurable for them.3 expert-approved tips for getting started.Get really clear about language and boundaries.\\xa0You want to know exactly what is and is not on the table because what works for someone may be highly specific. \"Perhaps you like the words 'slut,' and 'whore' but don't like being called a 'bitch,'\" Zane says. \"You need to communicate that to your partner.\"You don\\u2019t get what you don\\u2019t ask for. \"If you don\\u2019t directly tell your partner you want to be called a dirty slut and have your hair pulled, it won\\u2019t happen,\" Chiaramonte adds. \"We get what we want when we can clearly ask for it.\"Have a safe word.Now, sometimes, we don\\u2019t know what we don\\u2019t like until we get to that boundary. That\\u2019s OK. We\\u2019re experimenting a lot of the time. This is where a safe word comes in. \"Always have a safe word, so if you're not enjoying the experience, you can communicate to your partner that you'd like to stop immediately,\" Zane says. Your safe word should be a non-sexual word that means: \"The boundary has been reached. Stop.\" Some examples include: Red, sailboat, evergreen, cupcake, etc.Don\\u2019t forget aftercare.Aftercare is the come-down time after a scene finishes. It\\u2019s a chance to recalibrate, relax, and reconnect with your partner. \"Aftercare can take many forms, but often, it includes cuddling, kind words, and rehydration,\" Zane says. Because erotic humiliation is so intense and consists of a lot of things we wouldn\\u2019t want in IRL, we need to make space to contain our emotions and come back down to earth in a safe and gentle way.",

The show, written by John Enbom, Rob Thomas, Dan Etheridge, and Paul Rudd, saw abysmal audience numbers when it originally aired in 2009 \\u2014 Nielsen rated the show 0.0 among 18- to 49-year-olds. Starz cancelled it the very next year after Season 2, but Party Down organically grew a burgeoning fan base years later.\"Nobody was watching this show when it was on but then they found it after the fact,\" says Meyers.\"Yeah, like seven years later,\" agrees Scott. \"We got cancelled, rightly so, in 2010. Our series finale had 13,000 viewers. So we should have been cancelled as it turns out.\"\"That's a TV show anyone could watch that did less numbers than a Taylor Swift show,\" says Meyers.\"One concert would dwarf our entire audience,\" says Scott.Scott speaks to how the show absolutely died \\u2014 \"It's the late, great Party Down!\" \\u2014 but then reflects on the reboot getting the gang back together.\"It ended and we were so deeply bummed. But it also felt very Party Down to be cancelled. It kind of fit in with the ethos of the show...If we won in any way it just wouldn't feel right.\"Party Down is now streaming on the Starz app.\\xa0Here's everything you need to know before you watch Party Down Season 3 and here's Mashable's review.",

            "title": "'Succession's 'ludicrously capacious bag' becomes ludicrously capacious meme",
            "description": "It's been a few days since the premiere of Succession Season 4, and one standout moment from HBO's much-awaited melodrama is still captivating the internet. Beyond the Roy siblings' war with their media mogul father, a certain Burberry bag is hogging the limelight, spouting memes and discourse \\u2014 as any good TV episode has the power to do. This time around, the conversation is coming from a healthy mix of Succession fans, fashion critics, shoppers, and meme-makers alike.The bag in question was the subject of a monologue from Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), who spews his elitist wisdom at Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) about his date Bridget (Francesca Root-Dodson). Greg hasn't 'cleared' Bridget with the family as a guest at Logan's (Brian Cox) birthday party, which makes as many petty waves as Bridget's chosen accessory. Her bag is covered in the quintessential tartan pattern associated with the Burberry brand. It's far from discreet, veering into ostentatious, as Tom points out in a series of insults to Greg, starting with the now-beloved dig at her \"ludicrously capacious bag.\" \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Succession' Season 4: What's the meaning of episode 1's final scene with Logan?\\n            \\n\\n\\nSo why has this particular moment piqued the interest of the Twitter timeline? Some have suggested the underlying messaging to be that of quiet luxury and \"stealth wealth\", addressing the visible sign-posting of Bridget's bag which is at odds with the more subtle sartorial looks of all the billionaires attending the party. But others are just impressed with Tom's vicious takedown: a mix of hilarity and sheer cruelty, both known trademarks of the Succession characters. His questions \\u2014 \"What\\u2019s even in there, huh? Flat shoes for the subway? Her lunch pail?\" \\u2014 and delivery are now in the Succession hall-of-fame. He should know, though, that the Google searches for that particular \"gargantuan\" Burberry bag (retailing at around $2,500) have skyrocketed to ludicrously capacious levels, likely thanks to an ongoing slew of think-pieces and memes. Turns out, Tom's tacky is the internet's fascination.

            "title": "Amazon's latest Fire 7 tablet meets the tepid expectations set by its $60 price point",
            "description": "Sixty bucks doesn't go as far as it once did. That's less than six months of Disney+ (with ads) after its latest price hike, or a 10th of a Taylor Swift ticket in the nosebleeds (depending on the city and your luck). It costs $10 more to buy a new first-party video game nowadays. But $60 can still get you a tablet \\u2014\\xa0not the best tablet, but a tablet.The latest Amazon Fire 7 is a June 2022 refresh of the company's smallest and most popular Alexa-enabled tablet, and it's priced at just $59.99 for the 16GB base model with ads on its lockscreen. That's a $10 price bump from the 2019 version in exchange for a faster quad-core processor, double the RAM, USB-C charging, and three more hours of battery life. After spending a week with the Fire 7, I can confirm that none of those \"upgrades\" made a dramatic dent in its aggressive mediocrity. It's still a putzy little tablet with some annoying proprietary features that often make a case against it. That being said, I'll still go to bat for the Fire 7 as a passable portable entertainment device or a toe-dip into the Amazon Fire ecosystem. Its shortcomings are almost beside the point. Like, yeah \\u2014\\xa0it's $60. What did you expect?What's new: Nothing drasticAmazon's external tweaks to the 12th-generation Fire 7 were pretty minor; this was more of a freshening-up than a facelift. For starters, its 7-inch touchscreen has slightly slimmer but still-thick bezels and an identical resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels. It's solid for streaming shows and playing light games, if a tad too reflective, but it makes small text in app icons and e-books appear fuzzy. I found it a little distracting when I first started reading Spare in the Kindle app, but my eyes eventually adjusted to a point where it was tolerable. It seemed to help when I set the tablet to its system-wide dark theme, a new feature that launched in last year's Fire OS update. The white-on-black mode boldens the text a teense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fire 7's reflective screen means any photo of it is also a selfie.\\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\\n\\n\\nThe new Fire 7's 2MP front camera scooted over to the larger bezel to better support landscape video calls, but it still caps out at 720p HD (as does the rear-facing one), and pictures look grainy unless you're working with a good amount of natural light. It's definitely geared toward impromptu reference shots, not portraits you want to frame or post on main.As far as overall build quality goes, Amazon claims the new Fire 7 has tested \"twice as durable\" as the latest iPad mini in tumble tests. I'm not about to drop-kick either device onto the sidewalk, but for its part, I think the Fire 7 could walk away mostly unscathed, especially if it's wearing one of Amazon's compatible fabric covers (sold separately). The plastic back shell is a little cheapo compared to the aluminum of an Apple-made tablet, but it still doesn't make it feel like a toy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI took these two photos of my parrot Melon with the Amazon Fire 7's rear- and front-facing cameras (left to right). Neither is much to squawk about.\\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\\n\\n\\nFor what it's worth, this new model's shell also comes in a couple new colors: In addition to the standard black finish, there's now a light pink \"rose\" and a dark blue \"denim.\" I sort of miss the jewel tones of the previous generation \\u2014 these new ones are very much giving gender reveal party (derogatory).One thing I really wish Amazon would improve the next time it revisits the Fire 7 is its mono speaker: This thing sounds gnarly. The best way I can describe it is that it sounds like you're filtering the audio through one of those 1994 Baywatch Barbie dolphins \\u2014 kind of crunchy, kind of twangy. This was also something I was able to get used to as I spent more time with the tablet, but it was a jump-scare the first time I hit \"play\" on a podcast. (The Fire 7 does come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and Bluetooth support, so you don't necessarily have to rely on it.) More storage and battery life, but still-pokey performanceLet's get into some of Amazon's bigger promises for the new Fire 7. I'll start things off on a positive note with its storage capacity of 16GB or 32GB, which is now expandable to up to 1TB with a separate microSD card. (The 2019 model peaked at 512GB of expandable memory.) This is the one thing on its spec sheet that genuinely wowed me, and it could be a big selling point for anyone with a large personal media library they want to take on the go. That's a ton of space for a device you can easily toss in a backpack pocket or purse.Battery-wise, Amazon says you're now working with up to 10 hours per charge instead of seven. (You can also charge it via USB-C, which is a convenient, new feature for the Fire 7 line.) I was only able to squeak out eight during my testing, but that's probably because I had it doing a lot of heavier tasks like streaming and gaming; you'll hit closer to that 10-hour mark if you stick to mostly browsing and reading. I should note that there was no battery drain when I set the tablet aside in sleep mode for an hour, which is an improvement from the previous generation. I definitely wouldn't worry about it conking out during a flight.On the flip side, the Fire 7's \"upgraded\" performance fails to impress in practice. As mentioned, it now runs on a quad-core 2.0 GHz processor (up from 1.3 GHz) and 2GB of RAM (up from 1GB), which is supposed to make it 30 percent faster than its predecessor. That may be true \\u2014\\xa0I haven't tried the older model \\u2014\\xa0but there's still no denying that this cheap tablet performs like a cheap tablet. There's a slight delay after tapping buttons and an obvious choppiness to scrolling through apps, including native ones like Prime Video and Audible. Movies and games play smoothly once they finally load in, but social media apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook struggle to keep up as I descend my feeds. I feel like I need to apologize to the thing every time I pull up TikTok \\u2014\\xa0it's like sensory overload for its system.To the Fire 7's credit, it's extremely cool that a $60 device is capable of doing everything I just listed. It's just clear that it hates being hustled through it.The Amazon of it allAmazon likened the Fire 7's durability to that of an iPad mini in its press release, but beyond that and their general appearance, they're very different devices. I'm honestly not even sure if it's fair to compare Fire tablets with other name-brand Android-based tablets. The inherent Amazon-ness of their proprietary features effectively turns them into a whole separate species of device \\u2014\\xa0sometimes to their detriment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere's no question who makes this tablet.\\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\\n\\n\\nTake the operating system, for example. All Fire devices run on a custom-made Android fork called Fire OS, which revolves heavily around Amazon content. This is fine if you're someone who's embraced that ecosystem, but as someone who hasn't, I found it a little heavy-handed and off-putting. It's probably even more obnoxious if you opt for the base Fire 7, which displays \"special offers\" for Amazon products and services on its lockscreen. My testing unit was the ad-free version, so I can't speak personally to the sponsored Fire tablet experience, but Mashable reviewers have called it \"loathesome\" and \"spammy\" in the past.In a similar vein, Fire tablets also come with an exclusive app store \\u2014 the aptly named Amazon Appstore \\u2014 which has a limited selection compared to the standard Google Play library for Android. I was able to find most of my go-tos, but YouTube, Reddit, Google Maps, and Gmail were some glaring omissions that I could only access via webpage. (It's not a total dealbreaker, but it's certainly inconvenient.) Manual sideloading is a workaround, supposedly, but that's a Whole Thing I didn't want to get into.And then there's Alexa. Amazon's virtual assistant is pre-installed in all Fire tablets, and the Fire 7 has worked hands-free with it since the previous generation. I don't love the idea of my technology always listening to me, but the Alexa in my tester earned props for being able to tell me the weather and shuffle through the new Lana del Rey album while I was busy doing my makeup. Still, I probably wouldn't make it a regular part of my day: It went out of its way to involve Amazon services in its answers, and it got tripped up by some seemingly easy commands. Funnily enough, \"Alexa, turn off your microphone\" was one of them \\u2014 sore subject?Portable entertainment for penny-pinchersI probably sound like a hater, but at the end of the day, I think the Fire 7's value negates almost any criticism I try to throw at it. Sure, its performance is deeply average and it comes with some proprietary quirks, but it's fully capable of doing most tablet-y things, and you're only paying $60 for it. That price point is basically a Get Out of Jail Free card for all of its faults. It could never compete in the same league as an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Tab, or even most smartphones, but it was never meant to. It's not perfect, but \"fine\" is acceptable for the money. The most important thing is just knowing what you're getting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRe-watching \"Girls\" in bed in a pitch-black room: That's the Millennial Experience\\u2122\\ufe0f, baby.\\nCredit: Haley Henschel / Mashable\\n\\n\\nI think the Fire 7's strongest competition is actually the older model from 2019: You're probably not going to notice a substantial downgrade in speed or power, and you could put your leftover $10 toward a battery pack that'll keep it powered way longer than 10-ish hours. Unless you're in dire need of a whole terabyte of storage, I wouldn't upgrade if you already own this version, personally.Things get a little more interesting if you introduce some wiggle room to your budget. For a similarly versatile tablet with notably improved specs, the latest Fire HD 8 offers a hexa-core processor, double the native storage, dual speakers, and a slightly larger display. If you're going to use your device primarily for e-reading, the new Kindle features a nicer glare-free screen and up to six weeks of battery life. Both clock in at $99.99 (with ads), and it's easy to make the case that the extra $30 is worth it.If you value affordability and portability above all, I'll leave you with an insider tip: Amazon has put the new Fire 7 on sale for just $39.99 before. It probably won't happen much outside of shopping holidays like Prime Day and Black Friday, but if you keep a close eye out, I can guarantee it'll be easier to snag than Eras Tour seats.",

            "title": "The best barbecues for a sizzling summer",
            "description": "This content originally appeared on Mashable for a US audience and has been adapted for the UK audience.We Brits are good at many things. Queuing, apologising, and being generally awkward. We're well practised. Something we don't have much experience with, however, is sunshine. When the clouds do occasionally part and the sun delivers some much-needed rays, we tend to have a collective (but not literal) meltdown. And what better way to celebrate a bit of sunshine than firing up the barbecue?The first hint of summer and it\\u2019s almost like Brits are contractually obligated to get their barbecue out. It's a watertight deal. We have no choice in the matter. So with summer (or what passes for British summer) on the horizon, it\\u2019s time to buy, or upgrade, the essential summertime item: the barbecue.Fortunately, there are lots of options out there \\u2014 top brands such as Everdure, Weber, and Char-Broil \\u2014 but that doesn\\u2019t make choosing something any easier. Barbecues are a hot topic, and it\\u2019s easy to go cold if you get blindsided by jargon, features, and too much choice. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here to help. Here\\u2019s a quick guide to buying a BBQ. Charcoal vs. gas barbecues \\u2014 which is best?This is the ultimate question. Well, when it comes to barbecuing at least. Charcoal barbecues are of course the classic version \\u2014 and give that distinctive smoky, chargrilled taste. They also need fewer extras than gas barbecues which means they\\u2019re usually cheaper, too. But they can be tricky to light and take much longer to get to the right temperature. They're also much harder to clean. Gas barbecues are easier and faster to use. They\\u2019re usually ready to cook on in 10 minutes or less and have easily-controllable temperature dials \\u2014 not to mention other fancy features and mod cons. They do, however, lack that authentic barbecue taste, unless they have flavouriser bars. And the added convenience will hit you right in the wallet.It all comes down to personal preference: It's taste against convenience. Or you could meet halfway and get a gas-charcoal hybrid. Whatever you choose, it's all tasty stuff.How big is a barbecue?You can file this one alongside \\u201cHow long is a piece of string?\\u201d There\\u2019s no straight answer but charcoal barbecues tend to be much smaller. In fact, there are options that are extremely portable \\u2014 meaning you can take them on camping trips or even to the park. Gas barbecues tend to be bigger bits of kits. They're more like an oven on wheels and tend to suit larger gardens. Ask yourself some storage-related questions. Where will you keep your barbecue? In the garden all year round, under a protective cover? Or will you wheel it in and out of the garage every summer? Size up your outdoor space before making a decision. What are the important features to consider when purchasing a BBQ?It\\u2019s not only about gas and coal. There are lots of other features to consider. Here are some that might seal the deal for you:Cooking space \\u2014 That\\u2019s right, cooking space is always at a premium. Space might come in the form of side tables, condiment holders, and even hooks for your tools \\u2014 anything that helps maximise your BBQ'ing area.Burners \\u2014 On the subject of space, the number of actual burners (which you'll find included on gas barbecues) is crucial. Big family? Then four or even more burners might be necessary. Extra griddles and side burners are also a bonus. Fat drip trays \\u2014 Cleaning a barbecue can be a job in itself. That\\u2019s why fat drip trays are super useful. They can also reduce the amount of flare-up you get from the flames.Hood \\u2014 If a barbecue has a hood, it immediately levels-up your griddle game. This allows you to roast meant as well as grill. Especially good for cooking whole chickens. Keep these things in mind when shopping for an upgrade.What is the best barbecue?We have researched everything on offer and highlighted a selection the very best models to suit you and your garden. We've considered price, size, cooking speed, fuel access, and much more, so you don't have to. Just pick a favourite. These are the best barbecues for 2023.",

            "title": "A good pair of noise-canceling headphones are a necessity when you're on an airplane \u2014 here are our favorites",
            "description": "Flying has never had a reputation for being the most stress-free way to travel. In 2023, more people are prioritizing their vacations as a way to really unwind and disconnect from the stresses of day-to-day life \\u2014 but starting your travels on a noisy hours-long flight with nothing to do but ride it out isn't exactly conducive to that goal. Once you factor in that record numbers of people are traveling by plane, it's clear that doing what you can to alleviate your stress from the get-go is essential. Enter: noise-canceling headphones. Even if you're not a frequent flyer, getting a pair of headphones that can block out the sounds of a roaring engine, crying babies, or crying adults (flight delays are stressful), can make or break your travel experience. The good news is plenty of headphones, both over the ear and earbuds alike, offer active noise cancelation these days. While having options means you don't have to pay a lot to get in on that sweet, sweet ANC, those price differences aren't without reason. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            What to look for when shopping for the best headphones\\n            \\n\\n\\nSome headphones, for instance, offer different levels of noise cancelation, and transparency modes that allow you to keep them on while being able to hear what's going on around you. Let's not forget that ANC on its own won't save the day \\u2014 otherwise we'd just direct you to our best noise-canceling headphones. Comfort can be key too. It won't matter if your headphones block sound out well if you only want to wear them for two out of five hours of your flight. And for those who wouldn't mind investing simultaneously in their in-flight headphones and general in-life headphones, a few extra features \\u2014 like balanced sound and voice assistance \\u2014 can't hurt.With that in mind, we've rounded up some of the best headphones for flying to make taking all of those factors into consideration way less stressful than heading to the airport. But before we get into our picks, we've answered some questions on what you need to know before making a purchase.\\xa0Does paying more really get me more noise cancellation?Generally, yes. Many earphones and headphones offer noise-cancellation features but they aren't all the same. Typically, the more you pay and the better known and regarded the brand is, the better the noise cancellation is. Brands like Bose or Sony often offer multiple different levels of noise cancellation so you can choose to be completely blocked off from the world or opt to allow some surrounding noises to come in while flying.\\xa0As we mentioned, investing more can get you some nice features to supplement your ANC, like voice assistant support, expansive battery life, advanced codec support for better-sounding music, or better call quality. If you're a frequent flyer, the cost is almost certainly worth it. Do noise-canceling headphones help on airplanes?Noise-canceling headphones are at their most useful on airplanes. While flying, it's difficult to find a moment's peace when so much is going on around you. Frequent flyers may prefer to rest or work despite airplane noise distracting them. The best way to do this is by using the best noise cancellation methods to block out what's going on.\\xa0With that in mind, some headphones' ANC works best on blocking out people talking more than ambient engine sounds, and vice versa.Do noise-canceling headphones help with flight anxiety?It depends on why you have flight anxiety. If you hate the idea of being \\u201cstuck\\u201d on a plane, it might not work as well as if it's the noises that cause you anxiety. However, by being able to zone out and listen to your favorite music or podcasts, you can forget that you're on an airplane as you won't notice you're flying in the same way as if you hear all the surrounding noises.Similarly, if you hate flying because of ambient noise like children crying or loud talking, noise-canceling headphones can help hide this away from your ears, meaning you can relax better. With a combination of meditative sounds and music, the best noise-canceling headphones can whisk you away from irritants. Effectively, you can cocoon yourself away from the reminders that you're traveling.We've included something for everyone, from popular brands like Sony, Beats, and Apple. Onto the best noise-canceling headphones for flying in 2023: ",

            "title": "'Tetris' appreciates the magic of making video games",
            "description": "Tetris isn't quite as sublimely satisfying as watching the four-block pieces from its namesake neatly fall into place, but people making other video games movies should take some notes anyway.This is a perfectly OK film that explicitly understands that video games are cultural artifacts that are made by real people under real (and often extraordinary) circumstances. Games don't just emerge from the ether to make kids smile; they're the product of difficult labor and, occasionally, geopolitical anxiety. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Tetris' review: This movie is far better than it has any right to be\\n            \\n\\n\\nThat's the boldest move Tetris makes, bolder than even trying to T-spin your way out of a jam with a high score on the line. For most of its runtime, this is a movie about men in suits negotiating for IP rights. Contracts are drafted, signed, voided, faxed, shredded, and all the other fun things you can do with a contract. The core conflict here is 1980s capitalists versus Communists trying to get the best deal for their country (and maybe themselves, individually) in the USSR's twilight years.What Tetris lacks in factual realism (one of its subjects has admitted as much), it makes up for in convincingly examining the inner lives of the people responsible for bringing joy to countless players over the last 30 years. Behind his madcap, Reagan-era Wall Street persona, businessman Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) is a tremendously hard-working dude who sees a golden opportunity to set his kids up financially for life by licensing the game for global release. Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov), meanwhile, is torn between wanting to break the rules of Soviet society for his own (deserved) gain and wanting to keep his wife and kids safe.The interplay between these two men ultimately leads to the best scene in Tetris. Rogers, on a business trip to Moscow, wants nothing more than to commune with the man who made this perfect video game. His distinctly capitalist persistence leads to a dinner date at Pajitnov's apartment, something Pajitnov initially hesitates to do because of local laws about sheltering foreigners. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe best scene in the movie.\\nCredit: Apple\\n\\n\\nAfter a somewhat icy dinner (with Pajitnov's wife astutely observing that Rogers is \"dumb but honest\"), the two men retreat to Pajitnov's living room computer desk to play the titular game. Rogers notices something unsatisfying about the mechanics of Tetris: You can only clear one line of blocks at a time. He suggests allowing multiple lines to disappear at once. Pajitnov writes a few lines of code, and boom, Tetris as we know it is born.Amusingly, Pajitnov's explanation for why the game didn't work like that in the first place is that he just hadn't thought of it. All it took was another pair of eyes to create something beautiful. The two men then go on a lovely sojourn to a Moscow nightclub, where for the first time, we see Pajitnov crack a smile. Not only has he put the crucial finishing touches on his greatest creation, he's made a friend in the process.Is that moment cornball Hollywood nonsense? Kinda! But for decades, Hollywood has seen gaming as little more than an easy cash grab. Sure, I love the live-action Super Mario Bros. nightmare from 1993, but it's far from respectful to the source material and the people for whom the source material is a source of lifelong inspiration. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Tired of the Oscars? The 'On Cinema' Oscar special is the perfect alternative\\n            \\n\\n\\nThis one sequence in Tetris, which can't last longer than 15 minutes, has more reverence for gaming as both an artistic medium and a way to bring people together in it than the combined runtimes of almost every other game adaptation ever made. As a fan of video games, I don't want to see something I've already played get recreated in live action. If given the choice, I'd always rather see the conditions that led to the creation of a classic, and the real-world impact that that classic had as it swept the globe.Great art can be made in isolation, but greater art is made in collaboration. Here we see two men from opposite sides of the world, both literally and politically, coming together in a taboo fashion to make something special. They don't even realize it, but a tiny conversation in a dimly lit Soviet living room changed the course of video game history.Whether or not that moment played out exactly the same way in real life almost doesn't matter. It's genuinely heartening to watch barriers break down in a way that produces a stroke of creative genius. And, more broadly, it hammers home the point that video games, like all art, emerge from the trials of human existence. In this movie's version of history, Tetris became a cultural phenomenon because one guy wanted to feed his family and another guy wanted recognition for his work. Tetris is not an A+ film by any means, but in a world where Hollywood has so deeply misunderstood gaming for longer than I've been alive, that one living room scene makes me hopeful that future endeavors can build on what Tetris does right.Tetris premieres on AppleTV+ March 30.",
