But if you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.Where did Wordle come from?Originally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, Wordle rapidly spread to become an international phenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day. Alternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including battle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.\\xa0Wordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.Not the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for April 11.What's the best Wordle starting word?The best Wordle starting word is the one that brings joy to your heart. But if what brings you joy is strategy, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to the Wordle archive?The entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to enjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.Is Wordle getting harder?It might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more difficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to refresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:It's a substance, rather than a thing or concept.Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?Not today!Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...Today's Wordle starts with the letter B.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Wordle-obsessed?

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?No.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?I, D, C, and T.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

All of this is about them and ensuring that they have good learning conditions. Our working conditions are their learning conditions.\"Each conversation is led by a faculty member who researches the topic at hand, structured in quick, 24-minute segments, followed by 24 minutes of discussion \\u2014 an ad hoc labor seminar, of sorts. \"The idea is that it's as long as your favorite TV show, but better for you,\" Smart explained.\\xa0Monday's teach-in, \"Organizing for Community Control of Land in New York City,\" led by Dr. James DeFilippis, saw about 60 students in conversation with faculty, and Smart expects even more to show up throughout the week. The planned teach-in topics include \"The Ends of Freedom: Reclaiming America's Lost Promise of Economic Rights,\" presented by Dr. Mark Paul; \"Public Sector Unions & Black Americans: The Case of Public Transportation,\" presented by Smart; \"'Share Your World': Mobilizing Free Labor in the Spatial Data Economy,\" presented by Dr. Will Payne; and \"Co-ops, collective advocacy & affordable housing: wins & challenges across the world,\" presented by Dr. Bernadette Baird-Zars. Smart says faculty will continue offering the lectures as long as an agreement isn't met.\\xa0\"We're encouraging people from all over the world to join if they want to stand in solidarity with us, learn about these topics, or be there for our students to show support.\"The teach-ins add a focus on labor rights and organizing to other department initiatives across the campuses, like an MFA Reading Series put on by grad students on the picket line in Newark.\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\n\"We're not abandoning our students,\" Smart said. \"We're ensuring that the reputation of the university they're getting their degree from continues to be good \\u2014 that the university doesn't degrade to a point where telling somebody that you've graduated from Rutgers is a mark of shame.\"In the days preceding the mass walkout, Rutgers spokespeople expressed their desire to work with union representatives to ensure the school remained open. \"Our students' ability to complete their coursework and earn their degrees is the university's highest priority,\" the university asserted in a statement about the strike. \"Every effort will be made to ensure that the strike does not affect our students' progress toward graduation.\"By Monday evening, however, the college's leadership was suggesting legal action against organizers. In a Monday evening update addressed to the university community, Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway wrote, \"If there is no movement towards an agreement, we will have no choice but to take legal action to assure the continued academic progress of our students and prevent irreparable harm.

My beloved Kansas City Chiefs are champions once again. And it's time for all of us cord-cutters to figure out how the heck we're going to watch football in 2023.Fortunately, the answer is easy, if a bit pricey. Starting in the 2023 season, YouTube TV will be the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket, a streaming subscription that allows you to watch every out-of-market NFL game live on Sundays. With YouTube TV and Sunday Ticket, you can see every NFL game you could possibly want to see.And you might want to pony up the cash now instead of waiting for September. Here's why.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Why I finally switched from Sling to YouTube TV\\n            \\n\\n\\nNFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV: How it works, price, and early-bird specialIf you're not familiar with NFL Sunday Ticket, the main thing you need to know is that it used to belong to DirecTV and now it belongs to YouTube TV. In practical terms, that means you can now access it without a satellite subscription and, thus, without dealing with all the ridiculous hidden fees that come with a satellite subscription.But you're still going to have to pay, and pay quite a bit to get Sunday Ticket. The regular price for Sunday Ticket if you subscribe to YouTube TV will be $349, on top of the $73/mo you already pay for the base service. That doesn't get you Sunday Ticket forever; you just get it for one season. There's also a $389 option that bundles Sunday Ticket and RedZone, a special channel that whips through all the NFL action on a Sunday, going from game to game when the action starts getting exciting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's where you add Sunday Ticket and RedZone to your YouTube TV plan.\\nCredit: Screenshot: Google\\n\\n\\nSidenote: RedZone is 100 percent worth it if you really care about football. It's seven straight hours of commercial-free football and you only see the fun parts. It's intoxicating. You can add either of those options to your YouTube TV plan by going to your Google account and clicking on \"Payments and Subscriptions.\" That's not all, though. Google is also offering Sunday Ticket and RedZone through its PrimeTime Channels service. Put simply, this is a way to get all of the NFL action without paying for YouTube TV on top of it. Unfortunately, there's a big price hike if you decide to go down this road. Via Primetime Channels, NFL Sunday Ticket will cost $449, and the RedZone bundle costs $489.And that's still not all. If you subscribe to any of those options before June 6, you'll get a $100 discount. Suddenly, for YouTube TV subscribers, Sunday Ticket plus RedZone for $289 doesn't seem like such a bad deal. It definitely beats the price of going to a bar every week, and it's less risky than watching football through, erm, other, less reliable means.Whether you choose to patronize Google or keep watching football your own way, at least now you know there's a way to get everything for less than a month's rent.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/youtube-tv-nfl-sunday-ticket-price", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 19:59:41 +0000"}, {"title": "Lofi Girl has a new companion: Synth Boy", "description": "If you're a student, or otherwise looking for an endless stream of \"beats to relax/study to,\" you know Lofi Girl.

Step one: Lure us in with the screwball promise of SNL legend Bill Hader as the titular assassin-turned-actor. Step two: Masterfully modulate tone until we're left with an unflinching examination of how characters justify their worst impulses. The final result: a brilliant show that will leave you wondering who, if anyone, can earn redemption.That magic continues in Season 4, which steers the bloody saga of Barry Berkman toward a brutal conclusion. Co-creators Hader and Alec Berg fully embrace the darkness of \"dark comedy\" in a way that even the previous seasons haven't, delivering a relentless set of episodes that push Barry and everyone around him to their limits.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Beef' is one of Netflix's best shows ever, and it's all about chemistry\\n            \\n\\n\\nBarry Season 4 picks up with Barry in jail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHenry Winkler in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nThe consequences of the past finally caught up to Barry in the Season 3 finale, when he was arrested for murdering Janice Moss (Paula Newsome) way back in Season 1. Now in prison, Barry seeks forgiveness from those he has wronged, like acting teacher Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler) and ex Sally Reed (Sarah Goldberg). Unlike its main character, Barry knows that the road to forgiveness is longer than one phone call from jail. It also knows that in Barry's case, forgiveness and redemption are forever out of reach. Hader's work this season reveals Barry at his most desperate, his most angry, and even at his most frightening, as he continues to try to defend his own actions to himself.Outside the prison walls, Gene and Janice's father Jim (Robert Wisdom) have differing ideas on how to honor Janice's memory, a storyline that puts the heights of Gene's ego on hilarious, cringe-inducing display. It also cements Wisdom's Jim as one of the most fascinating and enigmatic additions to Barry's cast of characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnthony Carrigan and Michael Irby in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nWhile Barry is trapped in jail \\u2014 with former handler Fuches (Stephen Root), no less \\u2014 NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan) and Cristobal (Michael Irby) set out on a new venture with some unlikely criminal allies. What ensues are some of Barry's most laugh-out-loud moments yet \\u2014 I will never look at Dave & Buster's the same way again \\u2014 as well as many of its most harrowing. Of course, it wouldn't be Barry without some sharp showbiz satire thrown in the mix: After a disastrous stint back home in Missouri, Sally returns to Los Angeles to teach an acting class of her own. Barry packs in some quality gags about tentpole franchises, but it also keeps a close eye on Sally's reaction to Barry's arrest, her past traumas, and her own monstrous qualities. A scene in which Sally breaks a student down over the course of an acting class is a reminder of just how ruthless she's become, and how phenomenal Goldberg is in this role. Barry's cast has always been killer, but in Season 4, everyone ups their game.Barry Season 4 delivers series-best sequences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSarah Goldberg in \"Barry.\"\\nCredit: Merrick Morton / HBO\\n\\n\\nAlongside excellent writing and acting, this season of Barry continues the show's trend of creating some of the most stunning, impactful visuals on TV today. Season 4 is Barry at its most surreal. While in jail, Barry's past bleeds into his present: He sees Sally and his acting class friends running lines in the prison yard. Later, in a similar vein to his beach hallucination in Season 3, he recalls his childhood in an endless field somewhere in the Midwest.Hader, who directed every episode this season, and director of photography Carl Herse thrive in these darker, dreamier sequences. Barry may be more easily described as a dark comedy or dramedy, but these episodes are so tinged with horror, dread, and the bizarre that they escape classification. More than once, they'll leave you questioning reality.Barry's destabilizing quality is perhaps what I'll miss most about it. This is the rare series that can leap from gut-busting gag to gut-wrenching moral dilemma and always stick the landing. Moments like Season 2's \"ronny/lily\" fight or Season 3's \"710N\" motorcycle chase deliver a mix of the surreal and the mundane, the grounded and the heightened, all helping make Barry the force it is and the force it continues to be as it heads into its final season. Luckily for us, Season 4 gifts us many such sequences, at times even outdoing itself in terms of sheer storytelling boldness. It's Barry's final magic trick: a mad blaze of self-destructive glory from all characters that will knock you off your feet.The first two episodes of Barry premiere at 10 p.m. ET on April 16 on HBO and HBO Max, with new episodes airing weekly.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/barry-season-4-review", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 14:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "HBO Max and Discovery+ to merge into an app called Max", "description": "CEO David Zaslav's stewardship of Warner Bros.

The Times reported that there will be cheaper versions of the service, including a tier with ads. So you don't have to pay $16/mo if you don't feel like it. While this news may be exciting for Warner shareholders, fans of HBO Max might reasonably be worried about what this means for the service. HBO Max has been popularly regarded as one of the best streaming platforms out there, thanks to a focus on high-quality movies and TV. Removing \"HBO\" from the name and bringing in Discovery's more reality TV-focused portfolio could dilute the product.That said, it's already been diluted during Zaslav's time as CEO, which began in April 2022. Nearly 40 animated series and six streaming-only movies were unceremoniously pulled from the service in a money-saving measure last year. A standalone Batgirl movie was produced and ready to go before it was suddenly canceled, never to be seen by the public. And perhaps most shockingly, the app got rid of hundreds of episodes of Sesame Street.All of that is to say that fans of HBO Max may want to keep their phones at the ready on Wednesday when the news drops.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/hbo-max-discovery-merger-max-launch-date", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 13:57:19 +0000"}, {"title": "What the Webb Telescope can tell us about the TRAPPIST planets", "description": "Scientists have waited on pins and needles for more details about the TRAPPIST-1 solar system, a family of seven Earth-size planets discovered not too far away that could support life.Now the James Webb Space Telescope, the mighty observatory in the sky run by NASA and the European and Canadian space agencies, is delivering some of that much-anticipated data.

From the A24 auteur who brought you Hereditary and Midsommar, Ari Aster, comes a three-hour journey through the many anxieties of Beau (Joaquin Phoenix). A man in his 50s with a very complicated relationship with his domineering mother (Patti LuPone), Beau lives in solo squalor in his apartment, surrounded by a horror-show menagerie of the chronically anxious' worst-case scenarios both indoors and out. He must embark on a journey, with the audience brought along for the ride \\u2014 one that is funny, scary, deeply weird, and also maybe boring, according to the reviews. Suffice to say, Beau Is Afraid is likely to be incredibly divisive. \\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nHere's a little bit of what the critics said about the film, with minimal plot spoilers and some mood spoilers.Mashable's own Kristy Puchko:As he has in his first two films, Aster has paired powerful performers with a script that plunges into the surreal and the psychological. His movies feel like a dare, challenging audiences with visuals of beautiful bodies destroyed by self-loathing, audio that creeps under your skin, and plot twists that feel wrong yet oh, so terribly right.\\xa0... This is the world we know at its very worst... and at its most chaotically fun. Still, I can't promise you'll enjoy Beau Is Afraid. I can promise it'll fuck you up.\\xa0\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            'Beau Is Afraid' review: Ari Aster delivers a brilliant, 3-hour-long panic attack\\n            \\n\\n\\nBut don't worry! It is a comedy!IGN, Siddhant Adlakha:[A]bove all else, what makes Beau Is Afraid such a riveting watch is that it\\u2019s funny and terrifying in equal measure, often in the same moments. It achieves what Joker \\u2013 which featured Phoenix\\u2019s Oscar-winning performance \\u2013 failed to with jarring tone, practically transforming Aster\\u2019s signature close ups, of dead faces frozen in moments of fear and anguish, into Greek comedy masks. ... [I]t\\u2019s the kind of movie worth recommending for its ambition alone, merely to witness the audacious result of anxious self-loathing writ large across the silver screen, without an ounce of restraint. That it\\u2019s also a remarkably well-crafted horror-comedy is a cherry on top. Slashfilm, Chris Evangelista:There will be those who simply cannot stand the fraught world Aster has created here, and there will be others who are fully on board with what the filmmaker is dishing out. No matter the reaction, this is a film that begs for conversation and analysis and plenty of pondering. And it's more accessible than you might think, despite all the lunacy. Aster is primarily known as a horror filmmaker, and while \"Beau\" is not a horror film, there's plenty of the horrific here to knock us for a loop. Beau is afraid, and you will be, too.Consequence, Clint Worthington:Beau Is Afraid is ostensibly Aster\\u2019s \\u201ccomedy,\\u201d though it\\u2019s tinged with the same phantasmagoria as his previous efforts: Here, he\\u2019s stepping pretty visibly into Charlie Kaufman territory, using the language of cinema to externalize his deep-seated anxieties about his mother, his life, and every anxiety he\\u2019s ever had. ... It should also be stressed that, despite Aster\\u2019s pedigree and the suffocating anxiety of the situations Beau finds himself in, Beau is Afraid is also\\xa0deeply,\\xa0bleakly funny. Fiona Crombie\\u2019s production design sits Beau in a ridiculous world of absurd posters and signs ... and the sheer volume of Beau\\u2019s misfortunes become funnier the taller they\\u2019re stacked.Almost every review I've found so far namechecks Charlie Kaufman, so just take that as read. But that doesn't guarantee a rave review, of course.\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritics praise \\u2018Midsommar\\u2019 for its disturbing horror, surprising humor\\n\\n\\n\\nVariety, Peter Debruge:Aster tracks his titular antihero from birth to death, from psychoanalysis to this cheeky subversion of Freud, where the child assumes responsibility for his parents\\u2019 trauma, rather than the other way around. But he\\u2019s crammed so many ideas into this unwieldy container, the film capsizes. In retrospect, \\u201cHereditary\\u201d did too, but we forgave it because its finale was frightening, at least. Here, wrapping with an anticlimax seems to be Aster\\u2019s idea of a joke.The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw:\"Running at over three hours, Beau Is Afraid is a colossal recovered memory of mock Oedipal agony which is scary, boring and sad in approximate proportions of 1 to 4 to 2. It\\u2019s a movie in which Aster has surrendered some of his own originality and distinction for an indulgent, derivative flourish that seems to pastiche Charlie Kaufman or Darren Aronofsky\\u2019s crazy Mother! or maybe even Richard Kelly\\u2019s much controverted Southland Tales.\"Even the haterade-chugging Bradshaw has to agree on one point, though. Freudian freakshow horror-comedy needs its mothers (!) to loom large, and both Zoe Lister-Jones (who plays Beau's mother in flashback) and Broadway legend Patti LuPone are more than up to the task of taking on the role of Aster's Beau's mother.AwardsWatch, Sophia Ciminello:LuPone is absolutely terrifying in this film. She\\u2019s a towering mogul of a mother whose son exists to disappoint her. LuPone\\u2019s presence and brilliant choices as an actress make everything Beau is experiencing click into place. Beau\\u2019s fears and the bad luck that befalls him grow to feel even more outlandish and comical, but Phoenix\\u2019s performance makes them feel real and grounded in this utterly chaotic world.\\xa0... If the magical realism, difficult emotions, and detailed symbols feel a bit intense, that\\u2019s entirely warranted. Beau Is Afraid is an exhausting experience with too many details to take in in one sitting alone, but that\\u2019s also the point.In fact, more than one reviewer noted that no matter how long the film is, there's no question that it will reward repeat viewings.RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen:Any admirer of \\u201cHereditary\\u201d and \\u201cMidsommar\\u201d knows those movies are better understood with multiple viewings and a closer look at the mechanics each time. Part of Aster\\u2019s extraordinary skill as an entertainer, when revealing these plots about horrific relationships, is in playing with how much an audience gets on their first viewing, as opposed to their second or third. I\\u2019m curious, most of all, how the emotions within \\u201cBeau Is Afraid\\u201d will show more intricacy, or collapse under their weight, once all three hours of it feels more familiar.Beau Is Afraid is in theaters April 21.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/beau-is-afraid-reviews-critics-reactions", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 10:17:33 +0000"}, {"title": "Webb telescope captures the divine colors of a star's death", "description": "About 340 years ago, long before the United States was a country, light that had traveled through space and time from a huge exploding star finally reached Earth.Cassiopeia A, the wispy kaleidoscope of colors swirling in this image, is the youngest-known supernova remnant in the Milky Way.

Here's how it survives.", "description": "In a hostile realm of the ocean, where the pressure is over 830 times greater than on Earth's surface, scientists spotted a fish casually swimming around. No big deal. It's a curious-looking snailfish, and at 27,349 feet (8,336 meters) down, it's the deepest fish ever observed. Researchers spotted the critter on a deep sea expedition in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, located south of Japan, after lowering a camera with bait down into the ocean's \"hadal zone.\" This cryptic region is named for the Greek god of the underworld, and is home to the deepest of the seas. The record-breaking observation, announced in early April 2023, was made by scientists at the University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology.Even at such remote hadal depths, researchers noted that snailfish generally spotted in the region were a \"large and somewhat lively population of fish.\" Yet how might these animals survive such crushing pressure and isolated conditions? The answer is that snailfish, like this deepest-observed fish of the genus Pseudoliparis, are fantastically strange, with clever adaptations.  \"Overall, very deep sea fishes (those living in the abyssal and hadal zones) tend to be small, flabby or jelly-like, eel-shaped fishes living slow lives, [that] like to binge eat and hunt using the blue light of their prey,\" Jessica Arbour, a biologist at Middle Tennessee State University, told Mashable over email.  I asked Alan Jamieson, the chief scientist of this hadal expedition and founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, how he and his team reacted when they saw the record-breaking fish in the video. \"In total admiration for how deep these little goofy fish can go,\" Jamieson said.You can see the record-breaking fish in the clip below.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Scientists discover ancient shark swimming in a really strange place\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nResisting unfathomable pressureAt tens of thousands of feet under the surface, the microscopic proteins in animal cells are weakened and become unstable. This is problematic, because proteins are critical to the functioning of animals' organs and tissues. But snailfish churn out a chemical, called trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, that stops proteins from changing under such extreme physical stress. \"This name may be unfamiliar, but TMAO is what gives fishes their characteristic 'fishy' smell,\" Mackenzie Gerringer, a biologist at the State University of New York at Geneseo, told Mashable. TMAO is quite effective. For reference, the pressure in the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, is like an elephant standing on your fingernail, Geneseo explained. This deepest-observed snailfish wasn't observed at quite this depth, but it's a decent approximation. Snailfish have evolved their bodies in other major ways to withstand the relentless pressure. Fish in shallow waters use a gas bladder to float (aka \"maintain neutral buoyancy\"). But these bladders compress in the deep sea. So snailfish don't even have this organ. Instead, they remain buoyant with fewer or smaller bones, more cartilage, and smaller structures like fins, which makes them somewhat eel-like, Arbour explained. And snailfish skin is jelly-like \\u2014 as opposed to scaly \\u2014 to help stay buoyant. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnailfish captured on camera in the hadal zone of the Izu-Ogasawara Trench.\\nCredit:  Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre / University of Western Australia\\n\\n\\nExpert eaters in the deepest seasFood in the ocean's remote trenches generally isn't nearly as plentiful as near the surface, where hungry creatures will find bountiful algae and other creatures traversing rich reefs.In the deeps, life depends on nutrients sinking down from above. Creatures subsist on these particles, then bigger animals eat those critters. And snailfish are well equipped to capitalize on this prey.\\n    \"One hadal snailfish can have more than a hundred of these amphipods in its stomach at a time!\"\\n    \\n\"They have very large mouths and stomachs, so they can cash in on a large food item when available,\" Arbour explained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA CT scan of both snailfish jaws.\\nCredit: Adam Summers / University of Washington\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo deep sea snailfish collected on the expedition into the Izu-Ogasawara Trench.\\nCredit: Caladan Oceanic\\n\\n\\nTheir food often takes the form of small crustaceans, called amphipods. In the video above, the snailfish are actually chowing down on amphipods (which were attracted to the fish). Snailfish use \"suction feeding\" to catch these prey, Gerringer explained, by rapidly expanding their mouth and creating a \"suction force that pulls in the amphipod.\" But that's not all: Hadal snailfish have a second set of jaws in the back of their throat that crush the hapless prey. It's an effective means of eating.\"One hadal snailfish can have more than a hundred of these amphipods in its stomach at a time!\" Gerringer emphasized.Seeing in the darkThe deep, deep sea is either a lightless or largely lightless realm. Many fish are adapted to see the type of blue-green light that can penetrate through deep waters, though in hadal zones there's little sunlight to be found. But snailfish capitalize on the bioluminescence, or light created by organisms, in the darkness. Creatures luminesce for hunting or attracting mates, among other reasons.\"Snailfish seem particularly well adapted to seeing the dim blue light specifically produced by bioluminescence of their prey,\" Arbour explained.Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

New FCC leaders could offer hope for a fairer internet, though undoing years of net neutrality bashing is an uphill battle. Squashing these protections essentially gives internet service providers the green light to dish unfair treatment to certain web traffic \\u2014\\xa0like throttling a Netflix connection or charging extra to use a certain social media platform. And don't get us started on how it could affect smaller sites with smaller budgets.Discussions about the government's right to spy on your digital habits without a warrant don't exactly make anyone feel confident, either.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Using Google Chrome to manage your passwords is a bad idea. Here's why.\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhatever the reason, people are becoming more and more paranoid about the vulnerability of their internet usage (that, or they're just really tired of American Netflix). In turn, Google has become littered with VPN reviews and lists of the best VPNs according to experts, tech publishers, and regular consumers alike. But if you wanted a more raw take on the day-to-day VPN experience from normal people (with no filter), there's only one place to go: Reddit. What is a VPN used for?The bottom line is simple: People don't want other people watching what they're doing online, even if they're not doing anything wrong.A VPN (virtual private network) is an internet security subscription that basically allows you to make up your own internet rules. It acts as a bodyguard between you and your internet service provider (and hackers, and other third-party weirdos) by hollowing out a personal anonymity tunnel through which you perform all of your internet activities. A VPN's job is to plug the holes that could be making your data vulnerable to nefarious eyeballs, like creeps scouring public WiFi networks for personal information that could be used to steal your identity. VPNs are as wise of a precaution as antivirus software or a password manager (yes, this applies to Macs too). Hackers love free WiFi for the same reason you do: Connecting to the internet requires no authentication. That network is littered with unsecured devices, many times belonging to working professionals with bank accounts and business credentials that have phishers frothing at the mouth. Often, the easiest thing for hackers to do is slide in between your device and the connection point. This Man-in-the-Middle situation is like eavesdropping, but on emails, credit card info, and work logins. Other hackers use public WiFi to unleash malware to all of the suckers using the network without protection.Many folks avoid the public WiFi risk by recruiting their phone's hotspot. But on the flip side, cellular data limits might be an issue \\u2014\\xa0setting up a situation where both a laptop and phone need VPN protection. Many Reddit users suggest using something like EasyTether to share the VPN connection in a reverse hotspot of sorts.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best streaming deals for Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and more this week\\n            \\n\\n\\nAre free VPNs the move?Reddit has strong feelings about this. It's bluntly summed up here in response to an inquiry about the \"best free VPN\":\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: reddit/screenshot\\n\\n\\nReddit users will let you know that comparing free VPNs to paid VPNs just doesn't make sense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, and you'll almost definitely be skimping on some crucial features by taking the cheapest-possible route. The proof isn't always provided, but many Redditors are convinced that free VPNs don't follow a true no-log policy, or that they sell your data to third parties. \"Free\" is sometimes synonymous with \"slow\" due to fewer servers in fewer locations.The general consensus seems to be to only use a free VPN to test the waters, then cough up the credit card info (or Paypal, or Bitcoin, or Visa gift cards from your grandma). Most times, this can be done through a trusted paid VPN that has a free tier to experiment with, or via a free trial, which many services offer. In a rare turn of events, Reddit backs Windscribe's free service hard. However, free VPNs can step up to the job for more temporary endeavors \\u2014 like having access to your home country's streaming services while going abroad for a semester or keeping up with a certain sport for a season. Because paid VPNs only really get affordable when a one or two-year subscription is met, it may not make sense to pay $10 or $12 per month for the few months that you need a VPN.Here are the VPNs that Reddit users recommend the most in 2023:", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns-on-reddit", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 09:03:28 +0000"}, {"title": "I ditched my oven for this celebrity-brand air fryer and I've never looked back", "description": "When my six-month old Viking oven randomly called it quits on me one evening (leaving me with a sheet pan of uncooked salmon filets and a panic of rethinking dinner), I knew an air fryer was the next best thing. I usually don't have high expectations of celebrity-owned brands, but the Beautiful 9-quart TriZone air fryer by Drew Barrymore rose to the occasion when I needed it most. Not only did it help me survive an oven-less kitchen until the new part for my Viking oven arrived, but it ultimately helped me get more creative with my recipes.The air fryer did the job of everything I would normally have my oven do, including warming up my bread (because, gasp, I don't own a toaster), roast vegetables, and reheat frozen items. It also inspired me to try new dishes like the viral air fryer fried eggs (more on that later) and managed to look good while doing its job even though it's large and in charge. If you ever find yourself with a broken oven like me, or you're simply in the market for a new air fryer, the Beautiful 9-quart TriZone air fryer is certainly worthy of countertop space.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best (and worst) air fryer recipes we've tried\\n            \\n\\n\\nUsing the air fryerThis air fryer features a touchscreen display, cooking temperatures from 90 degrees Fahrenheit to 450 degrees, and six various cooking functions (air fry, broil, roast, reheat, bake, and dehydrate). What sets this air fryer apart from others that I've personally tried is the fact that it has dual baskets separated by a center divider, meaning you can whip up two separate dishes using two different cooking methods, at the same time. You also have the option of using the entire basket for one dish if that's preferred \\u2014\\xa0just remove the center divider.The dual cooking feature makes this particular air fryer great for cooking full meals (use one side for your proteins and the other for vegetables) as well as dishes that have different cooking times (for instance, cauliflower in one basket, potatoes in the other). Each basket has a 4.5-quart capacity (enough for a family of two to four) when used in dual zones, or a nine-quart capacity when using the entire basket during single-zone use.The air fryer whipped up my Mediterranean fried egg dish beautifully \\u2014 I cracked a few eggs directly into the parchment-lined basket, threw in olives and tomatoes, and sprinkled in some cheese. I let the air fryer run for about 13 minutes and the eggs were perfectly runny and the cheese was lightly crisped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThought-out detailsNo detail went unnoticed with this air fryer. For one, it has a nifty \"reminder\" button that you can turn on before pre-selecting your function \\u2014 this feature causes the air fryer to beep when the food is two-thirds of the way cooked to remind you to shake the basket (FYI: this works on all modes except broil, reheat, and dehydrate). I found this extremely useful, especially when hosting and having several other dishes to worry about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sync feature means your fries and chicken will be done cooking at the same time.\\nCredit: Michelle Rostamian / Mashable\\n\\n\\nThe air fryer also has a \"sync\" function for times you're making use of the dual zone feature. With \"sync,\" you're able to sync up two different cooking times so that all foods are ready at the same time. I used this function when cooking chicken cutlets and French fries as the potatoes needed a head start, and everything was nice and ready at the same time.Is the Drew Barrymore air fryer worth it?Aside from its useful details, this appliance is downright gorgeous. The lack of knobs and buttons gives it a sleeker look \\u2014 a plus considering its already-substantial size. It also has clean lines and comes in five different colors, including a muted blue and sage green. One thing that would be nice is if the handle hardware were available in stainless steel \\u2014 right now, it's only available in a golden-brassy finish, which won't match kitchens that don't have this shade in their design. I also like that the touchscreen light only illuminates when it needs to communicate something to you (like that your food is ready).\\xa0While the touch-activated screen is easy to use and get the hang of, sometimes it gets finicky and requires pushing the same button a few times for it to compute. Still, the air fryer is well-made, especially when it comes to the basket, which locks securely into place and flawlessly opens and closes (unlike other air fryers I've tried that require me to finagle the basket with two hands while maneuvering).\\xa0The brand claims that the air fryer can feed up to nine people, but I personally don't see how that's possible since I was only able to fit two chicken cutlets and a handful of potatoes in the dual baskets. Instead, I'd recommend this for small- to medium-sized families", "link": "https://mashable.com/review/beautiful-trizone-air-fryer-drew-barrymore", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 09:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "Get a near-mint refurbished MacBook Air for $385", "description": "TL;DR: As of April 11, get a refurbished MacBook Air for $385 \\u2014 That's 75% off the regular price.If you\\u2019re starting remote work, make sure you have a computer that can handle your workload.

Nina Gordon and Louise Post, the vocalists and guitarists of the band, met through Lili Taylor, and were soon joined by bassist Steve Lack and drummer Jim Shapiro (Gordon\\u2019s brother). They played their first gig in 1993, a few years before our favorite soccer players crashed in the wilderness. Their debut studio album, American Thighs, featured the song \"Seether\" as a single, and it got the band enough attention to sign with Geffen, which got them on MTV. (Also worth noting: American Thighs shared the same producer as Liz Phair's unstoppable Exile in Guyville \\u2014 another future Yellowjackets needle drop? Please?)Veruca Salt went on tour with Hole and with PJ Harvey; they even played Gastonbury's main stage in 1995. Their songs found their way onto the soundtracks of movies like Rachel Talalay's steampunk stunner Tank Girl and Darren Stein's jaw-dropping dark comedy Jawbreaker, as well as MTV's iconic animated series Daria \\u2014 all the height of cool.From there, it was an all-too-brief rise and fall from grace, as the band imploded under pressure in 1998. Gordon quit, and Post stayed on under the moniker, releasing other albums but never quite catching the same vibe. They reconciled in 2014 \\u2014 like, the band is still together, yes, and they released an album, but most importantly, these hard-rockin' besties got back in touch.

There's harmonious sweetness, femme yowling, and devilishly catchy lyrics. Then there's breakdown:\"Keep her down, boiling waterKeep her down, what a lovely daughterOh she is not born like other girlsBut I know how to conceive herOh she may not look like other girlsBut she's a snarl tooth seether, seether\"Although there is discussion over whether or not \"Seether\" is about Gordon or Post's temper, depending on which Reddit thread or comment section you read, that question misses the point. (Just remember, this was the '90s; even jocks knew the words to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" but only Kurt could get away with wearing a skirt without getting beat up. The virulent sexism and homophobia of the era was just the tip of the iceberg.) As Gordon said back in 2014, \"'Seether' was a song about being a girl and being told by society that expressing anger outwardly is unacceptable. It was about trying to beat down my own temper to no avail.\"\\xa0That could describe any one of our Yellowjackets, then \\u2014 in 1996, in the wilderness, in Misty's tragicomic Steel Magnolias monologue, yelping, \"I just want to hit something! I just want to hit it hard!\" \\u2014 or in present-day life with Shauna, her shaking hand holding a gun while she describes in deadpan just how difficult it is to peel the skin off a corpse.

Having already made a splash in the UK with quirky mockumentary This Country, Cooper's new show Am I Being Unreasonable? (created with co-star Selin Hizli) takes her comedic experience and splices it with drama, mystery, and a hint of horror.The end result is a weird mishmash of genres that come together to make a brilliant and disturbing show about family, friendship, and mental health.\\n\\n\\nWhat's Am I Being Unreasonable? about?Troubled, no-nonsense mum Nic (Cooper) is stuck in strained relationship with her husband Dan (Dustin Demri-Burns), worried about the odd behaviour of her son Ollie (Lenny Rush), and haunted by the tragic death of Alex (David Fynn), a man she was having an affair with. That's a lot on its own, but then to make things even more complicated is the sudden arrival of new mum Jen (Hizli), with whom Nic immediately strikes up a connection \\u2014 but is Jen who she initially appears to be?As we said when we included Am I Being Unreasonable? in our roundup of the best British shows last year, it could easily have gone wrong in different hands. But Cooper and Hizli expertly weave these storylines together to form a messy portrait of parenthood that's just the right mixture of recognisable and absurd, believable and psychologically twisted.Like the main character's mental state, the story is fractured at first, and nothing quite seems to fit. As we slowly learn more about the characters and their real motivations, the pieces come together.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOllie (Lenny Rush) runs rings around his parents.\\nCredit: Simon Ridgway/BBC Studios/Boffola Pictures\\n\\n\\nAm I Being Unreasonable? has a little bit of everything.Like we mentioned above, Am I Being Unreasonable? is juggling a lot of plates. But it juggles them well, with the script weaving seamlessly between jokes and foreboding, heartfelt moments, as well as twists you don't see coming. There are very few TV shows I've seen where I've laughed out loud and been hit with a genuinely unnerving jump scare in the same episode, but this is the kind of story Am I Being Unreasonable? tells. It's difficult to say too much more without going into spoiler territory, and that's something best avoided with this show. What begins as a seemingly straightforward family tale is packed full of the unexpected.Complementing all of this is the acting; the whole cast is brilliant, from Lenny Rush's precocious wit to the many masks worn by Hizli. Jonny Campbell's direction lets the sharp dialogue work for itself while throwing occasional curveballs at us in the form of jarring flashbacks.Watch the trailer to give yourself a taste, but stop there. Don't read too much more about the show.

Fielding questions from family about whether she and her husband would have children, Wray contemplated the bleak future they might inherit. At the time, Wray was a science communicator and couldn't ignore the projections of species extinction, crop failure, and increasingly disastrous weather events. Wray, who now studies the mental health effects of living through the planetary crisis caused by climate change, was stricken by a \"profound sense of hopelessness\" and found herself openly weeping on a train ride home one evening. Of course, Wray is not alone. In the U.S., one survey conducted by the American Psychiatric Association found that more than two-thirds of Americans are somewhat or extremely anxious about climate change. When the Lancet polled 10,000 youth between the ages of 16 and 25 from around the world, researchers found that more than half reported feeling sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and guilty. (Wray was a member of the research team that published those findings.) The trouble with eco-anxiety, a blanket term typically used to describe distress associated with climate change, is that there's no easy fix. As Wray points out, anguish is a normal response to the circumstances, and yet that despair can be so debilitating that someone experiencing it might need professional mental health help. If high-quality treatment is even available, it still doesn't change the reality that the planet continues to tilt toward ecological chaos as politicians and corporations fail to meaningfully act. In her book, Generation Dread: Finding Purpose in an Age of Climate Crisis, Wray attempts to chart a path forward for those who feel uneasy or even stuck when it comes to eco-anxiety. Wray's approach is holistic, weaving together various strands of thought from psychology and public health to help readers cultivate the resilience and emotional intelligence they'll need to fight for the planet \\u2014 and to survive the calamities that might come. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How the 'Doomsday Glacier' could change the world\\n            \\n\\n\\nThese skills are critical not just for people's long-term well-being but also as a bulwark against forms of extremism like ecofascism, which view the threat of environmental collapse as a problem caused by growing populations of racial and ethnic groups. The shooter who targeted and killed several Black people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, cited ecofascism in a manifesto. \"People are feeling unsafe and scared, because of what's going on,\" Wray says. \"While some, because of their environmental values, are deeply oriented toward compassion for other people and other species and wild places, some will interpret this through their own values and beliefs, and will enact violence as a way to make them feel more safe.\" While Wray covers numerous, often overlapping coping strategies in Generation Dread, she shared with Mashable three tactics that people might find surprisingly helpful. Use eco-anxiety as 'super fuel' Climate change prompts people to feel more than just difficult emotions. Existential in nature, it forces people to consider their mortality, the prospect of widespread deprivation and upheaval, and the possibility that many won't survive. It's no wonder, then, that some might first try to suppress their anxiety and grief. But Wray proposes a different, counter-intuitive approach. \"If you can have some self-compassion, if you can allow [those feelings] to be there, and then start doing the deep uncomfortable work of confronting the grief related to loss and mortality, or anxiety about how bad this is going to get, it teaches us things,\" says Wray. \"The torment becomes a way of tapping into existential meaning.\"Instead of a paralyzing burden, eco-anxiety can become \"super fuel\" that helps people learn how to cope and respond to climate change, perhaps through activism, community building, and making different consumer choices, like driving less and using less energy. But first, Wray says that wrestling with painful emotions related to climate change could, for example, prompt someone to imagine their deathbed and consider what really mattered to them. Would they be happy having spent a lifetime chasing money instead of purpose? Did their everyday actions match their values? Wray says this \"massively clarifying exercise\" can help people step into a \"climate journey.\" What that looks like depends on the person, but Wray describes it as using one's talents, skills, and passion to respond to the crisis, which in turn helps them remain excited about the work while giving them opportunities to make meaning and live with purpose.  Don't skip 'internal activism'Some eager to start their climate journey might want to shift all their efforts to activism, but Wray says that can be a mistake without also undertaking \"psychological and emotional resiliency training\" that helps alleviate despair and burnout. Wray calls this \"internal activism,\" a term coined by climate-aware psychotherapist Caroline Hickman to describe the work of being with difficult emotions, without self-judgment, and learning to integrate them into one's life instead of trying to avoid or bury them. When that is done in tandem with self-care, it can lead to more flexible thinking, which is also critical to responding to the challenges that climate change will bring. Critics of this approach might call it navel-gazing, or insist there's no time to do anything but organize politically, but Wray describes such complaints as a \"tired binary.\" \\n    \"We can be much better external activists when we're good at doing the internal part of self-care, too.\"\\n    \\nWray argues that people need to develop skills like binocular vision, a concept she adapted from psychoanalyst Shierry Weber Nicholsen. Wray describes this skill as focusing on the \"worst forms of climate change chaos\" while opening an eye toward the \"imaginative possibilities for a better future.\" With that ability, people can hold what feel like two opposing ideas at once, a form of flexible thinking that can make it easier to find strength and take action.Wray also advocates for stretching one's \"window of tolerance,\" a psychological space in which life feels manageable and fulfilling. That window shrinks when people feel hyper- or under-aroused, which can happen as a result of trauma, anxiety, and depression, among other experiences. Despair can set in when people lose their capacity to cope, making it much harder to fight climate change. On the other hand, that window expands with resilience-building practices that help regulate difficult emotions, says Wray. Such strategies include mindfulness, meditation, gratitude journaling, yoga, quality sleep, and spending time with loved ones \\u2014 basically anything that soothes the nervous system. \"We can be much better external activists when we're good at doing the internal part of self-care, too,\" says Wray. Prioritize social connections Coping with eco-anxiety can feel very individualistic. People focus on their consumer choices, perhaps buying an electric car and avoiding single-use plastic products. Or they might work through their emotions with a therapist. While these aren't bad strategies, Wray says there's much to be gained through social connectedness. Of course, being part of collective efforts to pressure governments and corporations can be rewarding. But relationships also make a difference when climate change brings any number of disasters, including extreme weather events.Wray points to studies on how communities with high levels of social connectedness and social trust cope following a crisis. That research suggests that strong relationships and the ability to achieve shared goals together lead to more positive outcomes than in communities where social capital is low. When people come to each other's aid, it can provide degrees of immediate and sometimes lasting psychological relief. That's possibly why people with high connectedness may be less likely to develop mental health disorders following a disaster. Wray challenges people to imagine a future in which people can leverage strong social relationships and mutual aid to rebuild faster after destruction and, as a result, potentially experience post-traumatic growth instead of persistent or chronic stress.

Then we've got the Netflix streaming guide for you.From old frights to new fears, we've scoured Netflix's horror catalog to find the best cinematic nightmares for darkening your device. Of course, not all terrifying titles are born of the same fire and brimstone \\u2014 so we've included a variety of ethereal ghost stories, stark home invasion horrors, gentrifying vampires, psychological thrillers, classic creeps, satirical scares, and more. Yes, Netflix originals like the Fear Street trilogy and I'm Thinking of Ending Things are on here. But we've also got genre staples like Insidious, plus hidden gems like Creep. Here are 20 of the best scary movies currently streaming on Netflix \\u2014 all of them packed with eerie entertainment value because you don't need to sleep ever again. Happy haunting! 20. The Babysitter Y'know, I'm not sure The Babysitter really works as a movie, it's more the idea of a movie loosely strung together by one-liners and style. Still, it's a fun way to kill a few hours. Samara Weaving stars as the titular childcare professional, a popular teen with a passion for human sacrifice and one-liners. Judah Lewis stars as the kid being babysat, with supporting performances by Hana Mae Lee, Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, and Andrew Bachelor. The sequel, released this past September, is more of the same \\u2014 so if you like the first, do a double feature.Where to watch: The Babysitter is now streaming on Netflix.19. Velvet Buzzsaw \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is some killer art. Literally.\\nCredit: Claudette Barius/Netflix\\n\\n\\nFrom the dude behind the brilliant 2014 psychological thriller Nightcrawler comes a hilarious \\u2014 and horrifying \\u2014 send-up of the Los Angeles art scene. In writer-director Dan Gilroy's epic Velvet Buzzsaw, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Toni Collette, and half a dozen other performers you probably love act their hearts out as fine art appreciators hunted down and killed by their priceless pieces. (Seriously, Billy Magnussen gets strangled by a painting of monkeys. It's awesome.)Where to watch: Velvet Buzzsaw is now streaming on Netflix. 18. Blood Red Sky Netflix's Blood Red Sky is one of those horror movies made so much better by knowing as little as possible going into it that I'm going to try to say as little as possible to get you to watch it. Directed by Peter Thorwarth, who co-wrote the script with Stefan Holtz, this action horror adventure combines the best parts of Flight Plan with tinges of A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night. Star Peri Baumeister is completely breathtaking as a woman attempting to protect her son from hijackers aboard a transatlantic voyage. Where to watch: Blood Red Sky is now streaming on Netflix.17. The Ritual In director David Bruckner's scenic tour of a hellscape, four pals hike through northern Sweden to honor a departed friend. Of course, their trip soon morphs into a torturous and never-ending nightmare \\u2014 with a killer lead performance by Rafe Spall. Slippery and divisive, this movie begs to be picked apart. More likely than not, you'll love the world it creates but hate the way it ends. Or, like me, you'll love the world it creates and how it ends. Have fun with it! And pack bug spray! Where to watch: The Ritual is now streaming on Netflix. 16. Apostle \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee a whole different side of Michael Sheen in 'Apostle'.\\nCredit: netflix\\n\\n\\nBefore Michael Sheen became the Angel Aziraphale in Amazon's Good Omens, he celebrated religion in a, uh... \"different\" way. Apostle is a completely bonkers period horror film that features Sheen at his most terrifying, playing a cult leader with an affinity for bloodletting and other \"creative\" religious sacraments. Lead Dan Stevens keeps the slow-paced narrative moving, with stunning supporting performances by The Politician's Lucy Boynton and Welsh stage actor Mark Lewis Jones.Where to watch: Apostle is now streaming on Netflix.15. ZombielandHorror-comedy got a double-tap of greatness with this 2009 romp, which imagines the zombie apocalypse as an amusement park packed with action, gore, and punchlines galore. Jesse Eisenberg stars as the meek yet wise Columbus, whose rules to survival have kept him safe since outbreak day went from potential hook-up to self-defensive homicide. Joining him on a rowdy road trip through a ravaged USA are hard-hitting Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), sassy Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), and snarling but scorching hot Wichita (Emma Stone). Can love and friendship blossom in this hopeless place? Does Bill Murray pop up for a kooky cameo? Find out by hitting play.* \\u2014Kristy Puchko, Film EditorHow to watch: Zombieland is streaming on Netflix. 14. Cam \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMadeline Brewer delivers the best scream queen performance of the digital age in 'Cam'.\\nCredit: Netflix \\n\\n\\nOne of the most underrated titles in Netflix's original horror catalog, Isa Mazzei and Daniel Goldhaber's Cam combines the tumultuous world of professional webcam modeling with the insidious terrors of a body-snatching whodunnit. The Handmaid's Tale's Madeline Brewer stars as Alice Ackerman, an ambitious performer eager to climb up the digital ranks who finds herself confronted with a doppelg\\xe4nger gunning to take her spot, her fans, and maybe, her life.Where to watch: Cam is now streaming on Netflix.13. HushGenius writer-director Mike Flanagan tackles the home invasion subgenre with remarkable clarity and creativity in the completely excellent Hush. Kate Siegel stars as an author living in the woods, who must use everything at her disposal to outsmart a killer. If you're looking for pure, unfettered suspense, then this is the title to cue up right now.Where to watch: Hush is now streaming on Netflix.12. 1922\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing like a Stephen King romp to spice up your streaming.\\nCredit: netflix\\n\\n\\nDirected by Zak Halditch and based on Stephen King's novella of the same name, 1922 tackles classic themes of guilt, envy, and evil through the grim lens of the American Dust Bowl. Thomas Jane and Molly Parker square-off to striking effect, painting a portrait of a marriage that is as at once remarkably absurd and nauseatingly plausible. The couple's son, played by Dylan Schmid, is just as compelling, with a heartbreaking storyline you won't soon forget. (FYI fans of the book, there are big changes to the adaptation's ending that didn't bother me, but could bother you.) Where to watch: 1922 is now streaming on Netflix. 11. UnfriendedI will defend director Levan Gabriadze's oft-maligned Unfriended until my dying day. Yes, the title is stupid. Sure, some of the acting could be better. Of course, that isn't what the average blender would really do to a human hand. (An immersion blender, maybe.) Still, I challenge you to watch this sucker on a laptop and not feel something lurking behind your browser for days to come. It's got a good story, excellent pacing, and enough solid jokes and gore to make its comedy a high point.Where to watch: Unfriended is now streaming on Netflix. 10. Ouija: Origin of Evil\\xa0The biggest surprise in Ouija: Origin of Evil, the 2016 prequel to the mediocre 2014 film Ouija, was when it turned out to actually be a good movie. It makes sense now in 2023, when the director's name of Mr. Mike Flanagan means something to us, thanks to the steady stream of horror content (like The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass) he's spent the last several years unleashing onto Netflix. But in 2016 this movie hit as a shock \\u2014 the best kind.\\xa0Set in the late 1960s, this is an old-fashioned tale of two sisters, one of whom asks the board to connect with their dead father and the other one who gets possessed by an evil spirit in the process. Flanagan manages to suss out big wallops of the oogie-boogies from the little wooden board and its recognizable planchette, which has haunted every sleepover for the past 130 years. (Ouija Boards as we know them date all the way back to 1890, if you can believe it!)* \\u2014 Jason Adams, Freelance ContributorHow to watch: Ouija: Origin of Evil is streaming on Netflix.9. The Fear Street trilogy \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou gotta see Maya Hawke's very short, but very good 'Fear Street' performance.\\nCredit: netflix\\n\\n\\nDirector Leigh Janiak pulls off a small movie miracle in her Fear Street trilogy, delivering consistently fun and fright-filled sequels that just keep getting better. Start your journey off with Fear Street Part One: 1994, in which we meet the cursed teens of a town named Shadyside. For years, the suburban haven has been terrorized by mass murderers \\u2014 all of them normal townspeople who seemingly \"snapped\" over nothing. Across Fear Street Part Two: 1978 and Fear Street Part Three: 1666, get to the bottom of the mystery behind these killings and their connection to the legendary Shadyside Witch. Based on the Fear Street books by R.L. Stine, this is a punchy slasher with enough gore and goofs to fuel a straight-through binge. Where to watch: Fear Street is now streaming on Netflix. 8. The PerfectionFrom cellos and foreplay to hallucinations and hiking, The Perfection does absolutely whatever it wants. Featuring Allison Williams in her best role since Get Out and Dear White People's Logan Browning in her best part ever, this vibrant genre blend will get a reaction out of you. Not necessarily a good reaction, but a reaction nonetheless. It's body horror meets psychological thriller meets occult drama meets classical music. With bugs. And vomit. I, for one, loved it! Where to watch: The Perfection is now streaming on Netflix. 7. His House \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'His House' is a hidden gem you just have to make time for.\\nCredit: Aidan Monaghan/NETFLIX\\n\\n\\nWriter-director Remi Weekes' His House is easily my favorite scary Netflix release of the year. Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu star as refugees from South Sudan seeking asylum in Britain who are assigned to live in an eerie neighborhood where they aren't welcome. Spectacularly frightening and ruthlessly critical of its subject matter, His House delivers everything it must \\u2014 and then some.Where to watch: His House is now streaming on Netflix.6. Vampires vs. the Bronx Want a movie that's got excitement, comedy, a scorching message about the evils of gentrification, and is a kid-friendly romp? Then take a bite out of Vampires vs. the Bronx. Oz Perkins's PG-13 horror-comedy centers on Afro-Latino teens, who recognize that a flurry of missing person posters and influx of rich white folks with tote bags means bad news for the neighborhood. Together, they team up Monster Squad-style to take down the bloodsuckers and save their community. With a sharp wit, a warm heart, a rich sense of atmosphere, and an equal appreciation for the Blade movies and '80s Amblin, Vampires vs. the Bronx is an easy watch full of rewards. \\u2014Kristy Puchko, Film Editor*How to watch: Vampires vs. the Bronx is now streaming on Netflix.5. Gerald's Game Another romp from Mike Flanagan, based on one of Stephen King's lesser known terrors, Gerald's Game follows a couple on a romantic trip to a remote cabin where things are totally fine and nothing bad happens. Just kidding! It's so, so, so bad! This survival thriller rooted in psychosexual trauma offers an exquisite performance by Carla Gugino who is devastating nearly every moment she is on screen. Really. It's Haunting of Hill House times 10. Watch it for her. Where to watch: Gerald's Game is now streaming on Netflix.4. Crimson PeakDirected by creature connoisseur Guillermo del Toro, Crimson Peak is a dark gothic fantasy you'll want to fall into head-first. Mia Wasikowska leads as a 19th-century American heiress, whisked away to England by her handsome new husband, played by Tom Hiddleston. Once the young bride arrives at her groom's family mansion, however, visions of ghosts begin to plague her. That her sister-in-law, played by Jessica Chastain, treats her with mysterious disdain isn't helping. An epic mystery with more exquisite scenes than you can count, this spectacular ghost story gives longtime del Toro fans the horror flick they've always wanted from the iconic director. Where to watch: Crimson Peak is now streaming on Netflix.3. CreepOh, you thought you liked Mark Duplass? Because he was the love interest in all those indie rom-coms, played that doctor in The Mindy Project, and is easily the best character in The Morning Show? Well, think again! In Creep, a found-footage film that foregoes pageantry for a stark sense of panic, Duplass plays a strange loner named Josef that freelance documentarian Aaron, played by writer-director Patrick Brice, can't quite pin down. Duplass' performance is intoxicating, and Brice imagines a universe so compelling it absolutely merits its equally great sequel (also on Netflix.)Where to watch: Creep is now streaming on Netflix. 2. Incantation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe film that terrified Tiktok. \\nCredit: Netflix\\n\\n\\nKevin Ko's Taiwanese horror freaked people out so much that it even started a TikTok challenge and managed to become the all-time highest-grossing horror film in Taiwan. \"When one imagines horror movies, it\\u2019s almost impossible to not associate them with jump scares, monsters, or slashers,\" wrote Rizwana Zafer for Mashable. \"Incantation does not rely on any of those typical horror movie factors, so it\\u2019s not really 'scary' in the traditional sense. Instead, Ko manages to terrify us using suspense and dread, built on the intimacy and psychological terror of the heroine. He plays on our deepest fears to scare us, incorporating elements of gore, trypophobia, and the eeriness of the unknown, that something evil is always lurking in the background.\" \\u2014 Shannon Connellan, UK Editor*How to watch: Incantation is now streaming on Netflix.1. I'm Thinking of Ending ThingsEmotional demolitions expert/filmmaker Charlie Kaufman destroys audiences once more in the mind-boggling I\\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things. Adapted from Iain Reid\\u2019s novel of the same name, this cryptically titled psychological thriller follows a woman, played by Jessie Buckley, and her boyfriend, played by Jesse Plemons, on a disturbing visit to his parents\\u2019 remote farmhouse. What follows? Well, that depends on who you ask.A transfixing meditation on art, existence, value, authorship, isolation, and more, I\\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things is a truly one-of-a-kind experience as profound as it is disquieting. You may not have a great time in this house of abstract horrors (especially when Toni Collette is onscreen doing those classically terrifying Toni Collette things), but it will be a lasting one. *Where to watch: I'm Thinking of Ending Things is streaming on Netflix. * denotes that this blurb appeared in a previous Mashable list.\\xa0\\nUPDATE: Apr. 6, 2022, 11:23 a.m. EDT This list has been updated to reflect Netflix's current streaming library. \\n", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/best-horror-movies-netflix", "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Apr 2023 09:00:00 +0000"}, {"title": "Twitter Circles bug has made semi-private tweets public", "description": "Twitter Circles is leaking, with users reporting that posts meant for a limited audience are instead being pushed out to millions of strangers.

The process of pairing your AirPods via Bluetooth might look different depending on what type of computer you use. Let's go with a Mac first. How to connect AirPods to a MacFirst you want to make sure that your Mac's operating system is up to date. To do that, click on the Apple icon in the upper left hand corner of your desktop screen and click on \"About this Mac.\" A screen will pop up, and there you can click on \"Software Update.\" According to Apple, regular, 2nd generation AirPods require macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, and AirPods Pro require Catalina 10.15.1 or later.Now that you've made sure your mac is up to date with the latest software, follow these simple steps to connect your AirPods. 1. Open System Preferences If you can't find it, it's the icon on your desktop that looks like a gear. You can also search for System Preferences using Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the upper right hand corner of your desktop.)2. Select Bluetooth I happen to use a Mac, so here's what I'm talking about.

Note: If you do not see your AirPods, double-check that Bluetooth is turned on, then restart the process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConnecting AirPods to your Mac is easy.\\nCredit: SCREENSHOT: APPLE\\n\\n\\nNow, what if you don't use a Mac? Well, the process should be pretty much exactly the same. Pretty much. How to connect AirPods to a PC or Windows laptopThe only thing that's really going to change is how you navigate to the Bluetooth page. Here's a few different ways you might get there: On a PC, open Settings from your Start menu. Select devices, navigate to Bluetooth and other devices, then hit the plus sign where it says \"Add Bluetooth or other device.\" Open the AirPods' case lid, hold the button, and select your AirPods once they pop up on the screen. The headphones should connect, then you'll click \"Done.\" Not all PCs come equipped with Bluetooth, especially desktops.

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?S, S, A, and T.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

Fans who've relished the nightmare-scorching visuals and deeply twisted finales of Aster's work thus far might expect something similar in his latest. Good news for fans: Beau Is Afraid is peppered with jaw-dropping horrors and jokes so dark you might laugh or scream. Yet, this epic \\u2014 which Aster describes as a \"Jewish Lord of the Rings\" \\u2014 sets its own course, trekking not only far from horror conventions, but from movie conventions as well. The result is a film that is shocking, immersive and so emotionally raw that it's essentially a three-hour-long panic attack as cinema.\\xa0Proceed with caution.\\xa0What is Beau Is Afraid about?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Takashi Seida/A24\\n\\n\\nIn its simplest form, Beau Is Afraid is about a fearful loser trying to make his way to his overbearing mother's house. Of course, Aster complicates this journey with a cascade of what-ifs, chasing down the worst-case scenario at every opportunity. What's the worst that could happen if you lost your keys? If you missed your flight? If you disappointed your mother?\\xa0If you've ever been tormented by a similarly relentless internal chorus, you'll relate to Beau's dilemma. He is frozen by the possibilities until fate \\u2014 like a relentless bully \\u2014\\xa0pushes him not to act, but to react. He is forced to leave the relative safety of his grubby apartment for urban streets that are booming with noise and chaos, littered with a rotting corpse, a half-naked dancer, and a fully nude serial stabber. Violence will push him farther and farther out of his comfort zone to settings disparate and not always obviously perilous. He'll find himself awash in the eerie comforts of a posh suburban family, amid a wandering theater troupe, adrift in an animated fantasy, all before finding his way to a mansion whose cold architecture warns us that it is \\u2014 in a sense \\u2014\\xa0a prison. And then Beau Is Afraid goes even farther, chucking audiences into a nightmarish terrain we could never predict. And yet you may find yourself smiling like a madman all the way.\\xa0Joaquin Phoenix leads a preposterously incredible cast.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Takashi Seida/A24\\n\\n\\nAcademy Award-winner Joaquin Phoenix stars as Beau, portraying the timid man behind a scruffy stubble; wispy, retreating gray hair; and an expression that glides from dumbfounded to aggrieved to horrified in the blink of an eye. This is an intensely demanding performance that thrusts the heralded actor through mind-snapping scenarios, one after another, as well as pushing him physically; a run to the bodega is treated like an obstacle course with life-or-death stakes. Even awkward social interactions might result in an abrupt attack, and so Joaquin plays Beau like a battered animal, eternally skittish. His fear is constant and twitches at contagious, urging the audience to generously share in his anxiety through each hellish turn.\\xa0Beau Is Afraid is structured less like a film and more like a novel, with each chapter chucking Beau into a new setting. Production designer Fiona Crombie masterfully distinguishes each world from the next, so that it might seem as if Beau has stumbled out of his movie, which begins in a metropolis gone feral, into something softer and more fantastical. These spaces are occupied by a ridiculous stacking of stars, which bring distinctive and dynamic charges to each chapter.\\xa0Paired as plucky parents, Amy Ryan and Nathan Lane bring a brightness so bouncy that simple salutations play as punchlines. As their daughter Toni, Kylie Rogers's growling menace offers a ferocious parody of teen angst. In flashbacks to Beau's childhood, Zoe Lister-Jones plays a younger version of his mother, Mona, with a snarling sharpness, while a wide-eyed Armen Nahapetian captures teen Beau's mix of wonder and terror. Celebrated character actors Stephen McKinley Henderson (Dune, Fences) and Richard Kind give wickedly funny performances as a therapist and lawyer, respectively. Parker Posey is perfectly cast for a third-act turn that is darkly, deliriously outrageous, and sure to psychologically scar '90s kids who grew up in awe of her.\\xa0Finally, Patti LuPone stars as Beau's awaiting mother. And here I digress to note that Aster has said Beau Is Afraid was first drafted ten years ago \\u2014before he made Hereditary and Midsommar. In LuPone's Mona, you can see clear ties to Hereditary's harried mother and the tortured bond she shares with her son. But here, the mother is not the hero or the anti-hero; she is the merciless antagonist. LuPone, a living legend of the Broadway stage who has defined diva roles again and again, makes a feast of Mona. She stalks into the room like a grand dame of film noir, or perhaps the sultry witch of an erotic '80s midnight movie. She spits accusations and insults and condemnations with such intensity that you might feel compelled to apologize to your own mother for being a damn burden. But most thrilling, LuPone is given a monologue that makes Toni Collette's nerve-shredding \"I am your mother\" speech feel a tad tame. It's exhilarating to watch this icon sink her teeth into this speech, and it is absolutely spine-chilling to take it all in.\\xa0Beau Is Afraid is a cinematic dare.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Takashi Seida/A24\\n\\n\\nAs he has in his first two films, Aster has paired powerful performers with a script that plunges into the surreal and the psychological. His movies feel like a dare, challenging audiences with visuals of beautiful bodies destroyed by self-loathing, audio that creeps under your skin, and plot twists that feel wrong yet oh, so terribly right.\\xa0Beau Is Afraid is a challenge in that its exploration of terror doesn't allow you the reprieve typically provided in horror. There are no jump scares to give you the release of a scream. The film instead operates on a wicked sense of whimsy, propelling its protagonist forward without much respite, despite flights of fantasy. So too are we pushed to the brink, wallowing in uncertainty and anxiety, on the edge of our seats over what might come next.\\xa0Ultimately, Beau Is Afraid is Ari Aster's answer to The Truman Show, a film in which an everyman fears that everyone around him knows something he doesn't and is out to get him. However, instead of cloaking that horrific scenario in the winsomeness of a 1950s sitcom, Aster propels us into modern landscapes, tweaked to a place of parody but not to the point of unfamiliarity. There are visuals gags, gross and urbane, found in graffiti, band posters, and the promotional art outside a curious strip club. In the final act, there is a music cue at once perfect and utterly absurd, which led surprise audiences to squeal. This is the world we know at its very worst...and at its most chaotically fun. Still, I can't promise you'll enjoy Beau is Afraid. I can promise it'll fuck you up.\\xa0Beau is Afraid opens in NY/LA on April 14, then nationwide on April 21.

Logan's death was sudden, occurring while on his way to Sweden to secure the GoJo deal. While he was presumably experiencing cardiac arrest on his private jet, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kieran Culkin), and Shiv (Sarah Snook) were all on a boat celebrating Connor's (Alan Ruck) wedding, with Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) calling in from Logan's plane to give them a chance to speak to their father one last time.\\xa0Logan's death felt like a one-act play, moving from the kids crumbling in despair to his colleagues figuring out the best course of action. We all knew Logan was going to die; his health's been alarmingly turbulent since Succession's pilot episode, but no one could expect it to happen this early on in the season, let alone with no formal send-off.

Kendall and Roman are both wearing black suits, and while you may think that's standard, the boys have always had an eye for dressing for an occasion, showing up in pastels or blues for Succession's other big family events. Shiv is the real standout, choosing a black dress paired with an oversized black blazer instead of her usual florals or beige go-to's.\\xa0Dressing in black for Connor's wedding was a curated decision that elevated the episode's tension while foreshadowing the doom about to come.\\xa0After all, we've seen the kids flex their fashion for occasions similar to Connor's wedding, like their mom's (Harriet Walter) wedding in Tuscany in Season 3, where they all showed up in bright pinks, whites, and browns. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Roy kids brought the color for their mom's wedding. \\nCredit: Graeme Hunter / HBO\\n\\n\\nIll-prepared as they were for the emotional shock of their father's death, they at least looked the part from head to toe \\u2014 camera-ready for a press conference where Shiv showed up teary eyed.

We watch them say their last words to their dad, hold each other, and cry their eyes out, all while wearing the suits and dresses they were probably going to wear to his funeral \\u2014 but to their brother's wedding, and Logan's death day, instead.\\xa0We should have known something dreadful was coming as soon as we saw Shiv pull up to a wedding dressed for a eulogy. Succession is a master-class in the power of details. While Season 4's poster hinted at what was to come, episode 3's costumes signaled a red alarm we all should have paid more attention to.

But their plateauing popularity can be attributed to similar complaints: too many scam profiles and too few legitimate users (ones within a reasonable distance to plan a date, anyway). Chappy was a promising app for gay men that shut down just as it was gaining serious traction.And at the end of the day, \"everyone\" apps are simply where masses of queer users are. Keeping Tinder on the back burner isn't just a straight people thing, especially for those who live in less-populated areas where Grindr and HER offer slim pickings. Plus, some mainstream apps do deserve credit for the steps they've taken to create a more inclusive atmosphere.

Some men have such a rabid obsession with queer women that they'll sign up for a dating site as a woman just to see an all-women swiping field. It's a total privacy breach at the least, and certainly doesn't boost your willingness to meet up with someone in real life. Many dating sites require some form of Facebook or ID verification these days, and in the case of Tinder, have built-in background checks as a feature of the app. Queer dating apps aren't always inviting, eitherDoes \"gold star lesbian\" ring a bell? The delineation is given to lesbians who have never slept with a man. Countless bisexual women have reported being ghosted after disclosing that they have been with a guy before, and profiles with \"gold stars only\" in the bio have popped up, too.Then there's the issue of bi people feeling invisible when they're deemed too \"straight passing,\" which can often happen in queer spaces. This kind of invalidation contributes to many bisexual folks' struggles of not feeling queer enough.Why people think you should still put \"bi\" in your dating app bioAdding those two simple letters to your bio will draw some unwanted attention, and it's going to be a pain in the ass. But in the long run, it'll also act like an asshole filter to weed out people who try to put sexual orientation into a box. The idea that being bisexual is just a pit stop to being \"fully-blown gay\" \\u2014 or that it means that you're attracted to everyone you see \\u2014 probably aren't thoughts you'd prefer a partner to have. The easiest way to ensure that you won't be left heartbroken over someone not accepting your sexuality? Let them know from the jump.One writer for Tinder's blog mentions that, despite his number of matches dropping once he put \"bi\" in his profile, he found more meaningful connections with open-minded men and women and had a more positive experience in general: \"For the first time in my life, women wanted to date me for something that others ostracized. I felt empowered and optimistic about my romantic future.\"\"Coming out\" over and over again is unfair.

Their source revealed the couple split \"a few weeks ago\" and that \"it wasn't dramatic,\" explaining \"the relationship had just run\\xa0its course.\\xa0It's why [Alwyn] hasn't been spotted at any shows.\" People independently confirmed the news that sent Swifties and Lover supremacists spiraling on social media.

For most, Alwyn is not even a household name, but for Swifties, he's the titular Lover.The Midnights singer and British actor started dating in 2016. Fans speculate they met at the 2016 Met Gala based on the lyrics of Reputation cut \"Dress\": \"Flashback to when you met me / Your buzzcut and my hair bleached.\" Because, you guessed it, Alwyn sported a buzzcut and Swift's hair was bleached. At a secret session for Reputation, Swift reportedly told fans that the single \"Gorgeous\" was about her \"angel boyfriend of one year.\" Other tracks off of Reputation like \"Delicate,\" \"Call It What You Want,\" and \"King Of My Heart\" are also thought to be about Alwyn. Her next album, Lover, is also understood to be about Alwyn with songs like \"London Boy\" \\u2014 Alwyn is famously British and a Pisces\\u2014 \"Paper Rings,\" \"Cornelia Street,\" \"Daylight,\" and the titular \"Lover.\" During quarantine the couple started collaborating creatively. Alwyn surpassed his muse status and co-wrote Folklore tracks \"Exile\" and \"Betty,\" Evermore songs \"Champagne Problems\" and \"Coney Island, and most recently, \"Sweet Nothing\" off Midnights. Other tracks on her most recent three albums canonically about Alwyn include: \"Invisible String\" and \"Peace.\" Phew, that's a lot of Toe mythology. And boy, oh boy are they. Out-of-context lyrics are running amuck on Twitter on TikTok. (\"Cornelia Street,\" \"King Of My Heart,\" and \"Peace\" are hitting Swifties particularly hard.)

Logan had a medical episode on a plane and the kids are left saying their (likely unheard) goodbyes into a phone held close to their dying father.

Sometimes, just the thought of putting on real clothes, coming up with witty conversation starters, and commuting to the actual meetup spot can be tiring. No matter what kind of encounter you plan, when it comes to dating, there'll always be some sort of physical effort required.The good news? There is one loophole: Sexting. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best hookup apps and dating sites\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhat is sexting?Sexting is the art of sending sexually explicit photos or messages to one or more people via text. Thanks to its recent rise in popularity, there are now apps for sexting and new sexting features in apps that are otherwise for dating in person. (Several dating apps began offering more virtual services as a result of the pandemic.)Sexting tipsWhether you're interested in giving sexting a try or you're a seasoned pro, there are a few things to keep in mind when downloading and using a new dating app to sext. Sure, there are fewer inhibitions when scoring a new sexting partner when compared to finding a long-term lover, but there are rules you should follow in order for all parties to feel at ease. Here are three big ones: Privacy. No app can completely protect your privacy for you \\u2014 that's your job. Though apps like Confide and Dust have certain features that are designed to protect your identity/content, they don't rule out all scenarios. For example, someone doesn't need to take a screenshot to capture a picture you send. They could easily use another phone or device to snap or record your photos and/or videos. You should always keep this in mind before sending anything that could be compromising, and do your best to make sure you trust the person who's receiving your messages.Mutual respect. Assess the situation and know your audience. Usually, it doesn't take much more than a few pre-sext texts (or pre-sexts) to gauge whether or not someone is interested in doing the cyber-dirty with you. Take the time to figure that out before you lead with something raunchy and uncalled-for. AKA, don't just start throwing dick pics at people left and right if they didn't ask.Mutual trust. Be respectful: Privacy is sacred. The internet has the scary ability to make fleeting moments very permanent. If someone asks you to keep something to yourself, do it. While sexting can be light and fun, it also requires a serious level of trust. If you betray that trust, you're ruining it for everybody.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best sex toys for masturbation that anybody can enjoy\\n            \\n\\n\\nBenefits of sexting Real-life dating is obviously the best way to get to know somebody long-term, especially if you're looking for any kind of serious, in-person relationship. And real sex will always be better than sexting. *However,* sexting is an alternative that may help you out in ways you didn't even think about. Convenience: Whether you plan to wine and dine on your date or just meet to hook up, it always requires some extra effort. For those with super hectic schedules or those who just don't have room in their life (for whatever reason) for a steady in-person relationship, sexting is practically a saving grace. After all, your sex drive doesn't go away just because you're busy. Sexting allows you to take care of your sexual needs without putting yourself out.Freedom: As is the case with most behind-the-screen activities, with sexting, you can let go of your inhibitions and get comfortable exploring your sexual side. Knowing there's a certain barrier between you and the other person may allow you to experiment with language and ideas that you wouldn't otherwise explore in person. Safety: We've touched on the reasons why sexting might not be completely safe in terms of privacy, but to its credit, sexting offers an element of safety that in-person meetings don't. Sexting allows you to interact with both people you know and total strangers without putting yourself in dangerous or unwanted physical situations. Your experience should always be what you want it to be, and with sexting, if it's not going in the direction you want, it's just a matter of closing an app.Exploring trust and intimacy: Getting comfortable with another person in close quarters doesn\\u2019t always come naturally for everyone \\u2014 but opting for sexting gives way to a new level of exploration in terms of intimacy and trust. You don\\u2019t ever have to meet the person behind the screen if you don\\u2019t want to, but being able to practice feeling vulnerable without any strings attached can be a great lesson in being more open.Fun: Let\\u2019s be honest for a second here. A night of sexting is always going to be a lot more fun than endlessly swiping right on a dating app and starting the same conversation over and over. Having the option of opening an app on your phone and engaging in a little virtual foreplay offers instant gratification and (almost) guaranteed pleasure.What to look for in a sexting appPrivacy features: What happens in a sexting app doesn\\u2019t always stay in a sexting app; there are no guarantees that your conversations or selfies won\\u2019t wind up a screenshot on someone\\u2019s phone. That said, certain apps include instant self-destruction features that delete photos and conversations after a certain amount of time.Safety: If you\\u2019re looking for a night of no-strings-attached fun online, it doesn\\u2019t really matter if the person on the other end of your conversation has been verified \\u2014 but if you do want to ensure you\\u2019re not being catfished or chatting with a bot, consider using an app that links social media or verifies users.Ease of use: You don\\u2019t want to find yourself in a hot and steamy conversation trying to figure out how to attach an image or a voice note. When it comes to sexting, the more user-friendly the platform is, the better. You\\u2019ll want something that\\u2019s efficient and fast.Subscription pricing versus free features: How much are you willing to pay for bells and whistles? There are several free apps out there, but if you're looking for something a little fancier, you can pay a few dollars a month for premium features. Best apps for sexting Since sexting, by nature, comes with a lot of factors to consider (consent and privacy, for example), we've picked out the best sexting apps to get you off \\u2014 to a good start, that is. Here are the best sexting apps for all your NSFW exchanges.", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-sexting-apps", "pubDate": "Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:04:09 +0000"}, {"title": "Best dating sites and apps for people over 40 \u2014 and which ones to avoid", "description": "Dating when you're 40 or older can be intimidating \\u2014 unlike when you're in your 20s or 30s, you can't assume everyone your age is single and looking. If you've found yourself \"on the market\" again, it's important to remember that half of U.S. marriages do end in divorce, so the dating pool isn't as small as you might think. Meeting people organically in public still happens, but sometimes it's easier and less intimidating to meet people where they are. There's a comfort in knowing that the people you find on dating apps are single (hopefully) and looking for a romantic relationship, so at least you're both on the same page.How to start dating again at 40The first step is just acknowledging that you're ready. From there, decide how and where you want to try to meet people. Dating apps have existed for decades, meaning they are the norm and not a last resort. You'll also want to be direct with what you're looking for. Serious relationship? Casual hookup? A friendship that might lead to more? Whatever it is, be upfront because you don't want to fall for someone, only to realize you aren't looking for the same thing. Yes, it's more vulnerable to say exactly what you want, but being straightforward from the outset is the new dating norm. As in any phase of life, dating takes time and patience. We spoke to Jennifer Frazier, a 46-year-old based in Indiana, who met someone awesome on Match. They went on a few dates, and she really liked him, but he was interested in dating a lot of women at the same time, and though Frazier enjoyed his company, she realized that kind of relationship wasn't for her.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best senior dating sites: Dating over 60 can actually be fun\\n            \\n\\n\\nDating in your 40s, 50s, 60s, or older can feel lonely when all your friends are married or in relationships. If you want to find a community of people experiencing the same things as you, we recommend visiting the subreddit r/datingoverforty \\u2014 it's full of people sharing stories of success, heartbreak, bad dates, good dates, and more. Just be aware that most dating subreddits tend to skew slightly on the pessimistic side.Problems you might run into when dating over 40While Frazier says the stigma around dating sites with the over-40 crowd is mostly gone, she doesn't think a lot of single men in her area are using these sites, so she's experiencing fewer options. She also thinks location plays a big part in how successful dating apps will be for a person, and we agree. Typically, the bigger the city, the easier to find a date. Frazier, for example, has a smaller pool of people in Indiana than someone who lives in New York or Chicago.\\n    \"It's hard to find a night off from cooking, driving kids, and all the other things we are responsible for.\"\\n    \\n\"I love the idea of Bumble because it gives women the power to send the first message,\" Frazier says. \"There were only about four men in my age range within 25 miles, though, so that was disappointing.\"Frazier also says having a family can get in the way of dating because you might have kids to care for, and taking time off from parent duty isn't always easy.\"It's hard to find a night off from cooking, driving kids, and all the other things we are responsible for,\" she says. \"I have faced pressure from men I have not even met who are being demanding of my time. I have enough demands without adding to it.\"By the way, if someone is demanding your time and pushing to meet up right away, we want to remind you that it's OK to say no.Do dating apps really work?While Frazier hasn't had the most success with dating apps, she does know a lot of people who have \\u2014 her sister-in-law met her boyfriend on Tinder. When doing research for this article, a couple of friends told me their mom, or uncle, or other family member met their significant other on a dating app.According to Pew Research Center, 57 percent of online daters describe their overall experience as positive. Many factors add up to whether online dating will be successful for you. Some apps use super in-depth compatibility quizzes that lead to really specific matches, whereas others present you with a bunch of singles in your area within your specified age range. Both have their perks. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best dating sites for introverts and anyone hesitant to try online dating\\n            \\n\\n\\nOne thing to remember is to have patience. Finding a partner who ticks all (or most) of your boxes doesn't happen overnight. Online dating or not, you'll most likely go through some duds and have some bad dates, but hopefully, that will lead you to a healthy, happy relationship.Which dating site is best for singles over 40?The best dating site varies depending on what you're looking for. If you want something serious, Match's 25 years of experience will help you find someone compatible who is also looking for a serious relationship. eharmony also specializes in serious relationships, but the site is really for people who want to marry their next partner, so it's taking serious to the highest level. Though, Frazier had a pretty shitty experience with eharmony \\u2014 after the extensive questionnaire, she was matched with a coworker's husband (yikes). While you would hope everyone on dating apps is single, you still want to pay attention to obvious red flags.Casual daters and people who don't want to jump into anything too serious just yet should utilize Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble. OKCupid is best for liberals and the LGBTQ community.

The pandemic may have changed dating forever, but one thing that hasn't is that meeting people can be really hard.Any person who's been single and looking for love at some point (read: basically everyone) knows that finding someone who actively wants a long-term relationship versus a hookup or situationship can feel next to impossible and minorly destroy your faith in love. Though dating apps offer a place to meet people, actually meeting that person who wants the same sort of relationship you do and clicks with you makes the whole needle-in-the-haystack search look like a cinch. All of this to say, apps or otherwise, finding your person takes some time. However, there's hope \\u2014 dating apps and sites are not the strictly casual dating space that they're sometimes made out to be. Over the past year, people have been \"prioridating,\" which means they're caring less about superficial characteristics and more about finding genuine connection and compatibility. This shift is reflected in dating apps, too \\u2014 more and more include dedicated sections about intentions right on your profile \\u2014 including on the ever-hookup-friendly Tinder.So, if you're ready for some commitment and don't know where to find these daters, or simply just need the breakdown of what apps are best for whom, know that you have more options out there than eharmony and Match.

However, there is evidence that relationships that started online might have a stronger foundation than those that started offline. A 2017 study cited in the MIT Technology Review found that people who meet online are more likely to be compatible and have a higher chance of a healthy marriage if they decide to get hitched. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in late 2019 found that 3 in 10 Americans had used a dating site or app, and 12% of Americans had been married or in a committed relationship with someone they met from an app. Whether it involves marriage or not, online dating seems to be a good recipe for a satisfying, long-term relationship.No one is saying that online dating is the variable that changes everything, but the research does point to the fact that people who sign up for dating sites that require thoughtful responses are more ready to settle down.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The people who found love on Twitter\\n            \\n\\n\\nHow the online dating scene has changed since the start of the pandemicCovid changed dating forever, and for reasons beyond, \"I'm fully vaccinated\" became a turn-on. Communication skills were forced to evolve in the year that most human connection was facilitated through a screen. People learned to voice their boundaries and have serious talks (like about social distancing) early on. Covid anxiety became a natural conversation starter and a universal way to bond. Though you can meet up in person, virtual first dates are still a regular part of people's screening process. More single people may now be more comfortable with delving into deeper subjects with someone they met online \\u2014 a great thing for serious relationship hunters, if true. Tinder thinks the honesty will carry over when things are back to normal, and hopefully, the aggressively horny people will continue to weed themselves out. At the very least, isolation may have simply forced more people to realize that they might crave more company than a booty call, or are down to be upfront with you if that's all they crave. Tinder says that more daters are open to \"seeing where things go\" than they were before the pandemic began. That means that you could have more luck finding something serious on a dating app that has historically had a reputation for casual relationships and hookups.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            What are romance scams and how can you avoid them?\\n            \\n\\n\\nDivorced people and single parents have particularly high untapped potential on online dating sites, too. Being in the over-60 group may mean that more people your age are already off the market \\u2014\\xa0but online dating can prove that the mature dating pool isn't as bleak as you think, even if your local one is.\\xa0People over 50 actually have an advantage over the younger crowd: Many people in their 20s and 30s just aren't ready to settle down. With life experience and possible previous marriages under your belt, older daters know the red flags and what they want.\\xa0As one person in the Reddit thread from r/datingoverfifty suggests if you want commitment, a dating site with a high barrier to entry \\u2014 like eharmony, match, or Elite Singles \\u2014\\xa0could help to weed out people who aren't about to pay a high monthly price just to mess around.\\xa0What makes one dating site better for relationships than others?Do we even need to get into why Tinder is a long shot? Is being introduced to nearly every person in a 10-mile radius worth the clich\\xe9 bios quoting The Office or how they're \"not looking for commitment?\" Sure, Tinder has its fair share of those lucky success stories, but it's also the dating app where ghosting, breadcrumbing, and every other disheartening dating trend flourishes.Singles looking for something serious ASAP might get frustrated with sites that only give a limited number of matches per day. But choosing sites that force you to be selective really heightens the focus on what you're truly looking for in a perfect match \\u2014 and gets you closer to cuffing status. For online daters who want the power to peruse the dating pool, you need to seek out detailed, high-energy profiles that give a well-rounded idea of who you're messaging. Apps and sites that guide your search with compatibility scores based on questionnaires  \\u2014 like eharmony and OkCupid \\u2014 can give a greater sense of direction in your search than location-based apps like Tinder. Plus, seeing an actual compatibility number attached to someone's profile just makes more sense than occasionally being thrown \"top picks\" you seem to have nothing in common with (looking at you, Hinge). Beyond putting all your faith in the power of the score, you can tell how much other daters care about the process by how much effort they put into their profile. If a single sentence about being drama free is the extent of someone's bio, you can assume that 1. they're not taking this seriously and 2. they create drama. When you're looking for something real and long-term, hearing what an algorithm has to say, along with being discerning and following your gut, can take you far. OkCupid has a particularly strong red flag game: The site has found that personal politics are a major deciding factor for young people choosing a partner, and profile building revolves around make-or-break stances on things like women's issues or whether they bother to vote. Aside from a compatibility percentage, OkCupid shows what issues the person gives a shit about (or not), so you don't get stuck on a first date with someone who's on the opposite end of the spectrum.Potential matches will analyze your dating profile, so make sure it does you justice On its face, it makes sense to question the legitimacy of a connection with someone who is only showcasing their best self. Then again, how much more information are you really getting from the tipsy person hitting on you at the bar aside from what they look like IRL? The dating sites that let users express themselves with prompts \\u2014 from favorite movies to where you want to retire \\u2014 are setting you up for success by avoiding an unnecessary argument six months in.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            6 ways to make your dating app profile stand out from the crowd\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe best way to attract genuine people? Be authentic yourself. That's easier said than done when your biggest worry is that a truthful answer \\u2014\\xa0like the fact that you might not be as good of a communicator as you would like \\u2014\\xa0will deter \"the one\" from swiping right. But deep down, you know that lying on a compatibility questionnaire probably won't lead to a healthy relationship. It's crucial to remind yourself that people who get freaked out by your honesty aren't ideal potential partners, anyway. Besides, relationships can be hard enough work without all the effort it would take to upkeep a version of yourself that simply isn't real. Trust that your right person will also want to date a person \\u2014 as in a flawed but lovable human being and not a perfect partner robot. Speaking of robots, we've left out the dating sites that get torn apart in reviews for being ravaged by scammers and fake profiles, but asking to video chat before meeting up IRL is a smart way to confirm that the photos match the person behind them.Until a smarter AI can read minds and simply ban hookup seekers from serious sites, these are the best datings sites for serious relationships:", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-dating-sites-for-serious-relationships", "pubDate": "Mon, 10 Apr 2023 16:51:48 +0000"}, {"title": "Looking for love on campus? Here are the best dating apps for college students.", "description": "We love a good party as much as anyone. But the logistics of trying to get to know someone in a packed basement over blaring trap music while someone does body shots in the corner are a bit challenging. It's not exactly the ideal environment for romance. (Although maybe you're not looking for romance? Party on, friend.)Dating apps are the saving grace of college students everywhere. Whether you\\u2019re serious about finding someone or just looking for a quick hookup, you may not need to look further than the right app. After all, everyone\\u2019s doing it.At this point there are dating apps for every niche you can think of; whether you're into gaming, geek culture, getting high, or focusing on your career, there are people seeking the same things you are. As a college student, you have specific needs and probably don't want to wade through all the older people trying to get married ASAP. You need dating apps that are specifically suited for other college-aged people looking for love on campus.Online dating 101It probably seems obvious, but the first rule of online dating is to just be yourself. It's all too easy to pretend to be someone you're not online, but that kind of catfishing game won't result in a true connection. By being yourself and presenting who you are accurately and honestly, you open yourself up to the possibility of a great relationship with someone who likes you just the way you are. And isn't that the whole point of dating?Don't be afraid to make the first move. Forget all those outdated rules that say a man is supposed to make the first move or that a woman can't pay on the first date. Instead, focus on finding an equal partner who helps support your goals, wants to see you succeed, and has dreams of their own.Get a bit more creative with your messaging than the standard \"Hey.\" If you're looking to connect with someone on campus, then open up the conversation with a question about them and a little bit about yourself. Messaging someone is more discussion group than lecture hall \\u2014 it's about passing the conversation back and forth.\\xa0Once you decide to meet up \\u2014 which is the entire point, after all \\u2014 stay open. We often come up with an idea for how someone will be after meeting them online, and it's rare that our expectations sync up with reality. Allow yourself to really get to know this person for who they are rather than who you thought they would be before you make up your mind.That said, it's crucial that you're honest. If you really don't feel a connection, then do the right thing and tell them. A good line to use is something like, \"I've really enjoyed meeting you but I think there are probably better people out there for both of us.\" Not only will they appreciate your candor, but it will alleviate that post-date awkwardness of wondering where you stand. Ghosting sucks for everyone. Just be upfront and save the both of you a lot of discomfort and uncertainty.On the other hand, what if you really do like them after finally meeting in person? Then what? Set up your next date while you're still hanging out. That old rule about waiting three days to call? It's dead. RIP outdated dating \"rules.\" Make plans to do something low-key, and for the first few dates make sure the plans are to meet in a public place. (A retro arcade or the student union could be a good, low-stakes meeting place. Bowling is always a good choice, too.) The benefits of making a date to do an activity cannot be overstated. It provides you with ample conversation starters and gives you the opportunity to get a little competitive and joke around. Some playful teasing goes a long way. And remember: It's all about having fun.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Best dating sites for introverts, wallflowers, and anyone hesitant to try online dating\\n            \\n\\n\\nSo what are the best dating apps for college students?Our best picks for college students are the following: We like OkCupid for its inclusivity, ease of use, and fun algorithms.

Not because there aren't enough geeks out there \\u2014\\xa0how do you think Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing film of all time? (Thanks to geeks, that's how.)

For men, it can involve a lot of simply trying to not be that guy.

Look for a happy medium between your personal interests and site popularity to ensure you have plenty of options.Security: Dating apps and websites are great \\u2014 but like everything else online, you have to be careful. If you want to avoid potential catfishing or other scams, look for features like social media integration, photo verification, and the ability to block any unsavory members.Budget: Do you want to stick to free websites and apps or do you have the budget (and interest) to pay for some extra bells and whistles? You can absolutely get away with opting for free services but a couple of dollars per month to speed up the process might be worth considering.So what are the best dating sites for geeks?Our top picks include OkCupid, which prides itself on being extremely gender-inclusive and a space safe for everyone, and Match, which has a tried-and-true algorithm and a huge user base.

We get that, on some level, there's a certain appeal to the coffee shop meet-cute or fun situation-ship that gradually and naturally turns into something more. But frankly, we're tired of everyone ignoring the fact that dating apps give you the chance to meet a whole group of people you might not have otherwise. And once you find someone you click with, how your relationship develops in person is pretty much indistinguishable from non-app origin stories.Is online dating worth it?Sentiments aside, we have some hard data to back our reasoning for Why Online Dating Is Worthwhile\\u2122: Statista predicted that the online dating audience will grow to 53.3 million by 2025, compared to 44.2 million users in 2020. A study from Stanford released in 2019 asserted that online dating is officially the most common way for U.S. couples to meet, rounding out at nearly 40 percent of couples having first met online.This pre-pandemic prediction came before the COVID-era dating app sign-ups surge. Though people are eager to get back to doing as many things IRL as possible now, dating apps are still a great place to find someone, whether you want a relationship or are just looking to get nasty. And yes, though there are algorithms that dictate what profiles pop up on your screen, we firmly believe that the stars aligning still comes into play.

Dating sites that are older than most members of Gen Z (like Match and eharmony) have been forced to give serious attention to their smartphone counterparts if they don't want to be outgrown.However, that statistical promise still requires patience and a game plan,\\xa0the game plan is choosing the dating app with features that best fit your lifestyle \\u2014 and the lifestyle of the type of person you're looking for. Are you looking for an app strictly for sex or an app more serious than Tinder but less serious than eharmony? Or maybe, you'd just really love to find an app where queer women aren't relentlessly sexualized by creeps and pestered by unicorn hunters.Feeling weird about dating post-Covid restrictions? Yeah, you're not alone.Despite restaurant capacities returning to normal, the idea of swiping just for the hell of it isn't feeling so normal. COVID is still a real issue, and there's definitely a collective Fear of Dating Again. Despite the risks on places like college campuses, there are still lots of people that desire a connection beyond frat parties. Whether you're looking for love on campus or just looking for the next hookup, make sure to approach it safely. \\n    Seeing humans in real life isn't something to take for granted. \\n    \\nBut this invisible hump may play to the advantage of people looking for a connection past a booty call. After watching budding relationships stay stagnant in the \"It's a match!\" phase, time feels more valuable. The pent-up energy it takes to go on a date feels like it'd be better spent on someone you actually see potential with. Even the horniest of them all may be more closely considering the authenticity and personality of prospects \\u2014 because, as we all learned, seeing humans in real life isn't something to take for granted.FWIW, communication skills may have gotten better, or at least more important to people, during the pandemic. Hashing out COVID-related issues with strangers required getting comfortable with personal boundaries and learning how to discuss anxieties with someone new. Tinder thinks the honesty will carry over as the new dating norm, which means you can feel comfortable knowing more people are comfortable saying exactly what they want, even if they quite don't know what that is. You can even tell if someone is vaccinated based on their profile on most dating apps, so that saves you from any awkward anti-vax conversations.Which dating apps are actually good?When it comes to your dating app options, it's true that the apps you're likely to find the most success on are the ones with actual active users (this is a Zoosk subtweet). Though we get that everyone has their problems with the established choices, new apps don't always equal better apps. Every year, a slew of trendy apps try to set themselves apart from Tinder and Bumble: In 2017, apps like Hater (which matched people based on things they disliked, like slow walkers or Donald Trump), and The League (a snooty, members-only matchmaker with a ridiculous waitlist) were expected to be game-changers. Hater has since disappeared from the App Store, while The League's reviews have gotten increasingly questionable. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to change your Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge location while traveling\\n            \\n\\n\\nIt's hard to pinpoint the exact reason why such promising ideas didn't make the cut \\u2014\\xa0but whether they were too exclusive, too niche, or begging for catfish, it's clear that there's a very special ingredient that makes apps like Hinge pop off. Honestly, most times, your best options will lie in established apps that are making efforts to intentionally upgrade their features and content. Choosing the apps that are best for youOne app's secret ingredient might not be the one you necessarily want to include in your dating recipe. If you already live in a large metropolitan area, Tinder's pull of its large user base is a little less strong, since, likely, more niche apps will have a decent number of profiles near you. Some people are dedicated to keeping their search for love free of cost, so sites like Match or eharmony, where most if not all features live behind a paywall, will likely not be your first pick. For others, behind that paywall is where they find the reassurance that users are likely not dropping cash to mess around or not go on actual dates.Of course, knowing exactly what you want isn't always easy to say, especially when pulling from the abstract. There's nothing wrong with flying free from the Tinder nest and trying out a few apps or sites you wouldn't usually. Overall, we say embrace the messy ride that is dating.

What should I consider when choosing a dating site?What kind of relationship are you interested in finding? Before signing up for any dating app, consider exactly what you\\u2019re hoping to find.

Sites that have lots of users mean lots of chances to match with someone you click with.Ease of use: Most apps and websites are pretty straightforward \\u2014 but certain sites are much more clear and easy to sign up for than others. Certain sites will give you a multi-step sign-up with endless questionnaires to better match you\\u2014but there are many apps and sites that skip over all that and get straight into it if you just want to browse around. Social media integration: Dating sites with social media integration are going to be your best bet in terms of making sure you\\u2019re chatting with real people and not bots or catfish. This doesn't mean you have to actively be on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, but many apps will use third-party social media verification to signal to other users that you are, in fact, real. There are even websites available that only match you with friends-of-friends if you\\u2019re particularly concerned on that front. Security: Online dating can present some new risks, particularly in the form of fake accounts. You want to aim for sites that offer photo verification and the ability to block any unsavory members who might be looking for a target to take advantage of.Budget: There are lots of free sites and apps out there \\u2014 but the free version is often lacking in in-depth features and other aspects that make meeting someone easier.

The onslaught of men grasping at straws for attention with messages saying \"think they saw you somewhere\" or requesting nudes in their opening line is an online dating specialty.

But if you're frustrated with horny jerks disguising themselves as relationship seekers or actual relationship seekers who can't handle it when you say you're just looking for a hookup, opting for a dating site more finely tuned to what you're looking for lets you narrow the pool and save some time. Maybe you can't stand starting every conversation from scratch. Maybe your biggest fear is ending up on a date with someone who doesn't care about voting. Instead of a half-assed bio, dating apps that delve into someone's hobbies, favorite movies, career goals, or political views before even talking to them provide a wealth of clever icebreakers to ensure that you aren't going into things blindly. Dating apps are trying to make things safer IRLMeeting someone from the internet in person for the first time is nerve-wracking for anyone. But for women, it can dredge up the same fear that occurs when walking alone past a big group of men. Though there are always some precautions you can take, having in-app safety features can go a long way in making you more comfortable with online dating.Match Group is making strides toward a safer dating experience: Tinder was the first to unveil features coming out of its partnership with Noonlight, a safety app that tracks the location of users and notifies authorities if there are concerns. Before heading out on a date, Tinder users can log info about where they're going and who they're meeting, as well as hit a panic button to alert authorities if there's an emergency. (Match Group plans to roll out the same features for its other apps, like Hinge and OkCupid, later.) As of March 2022, after a year of testing, all Tinder users can access free background checks on their matches.

Even putting aside the fact that online dating technically makes possible more face-to-face interactions with people that you probably wouldn't have met otherwise, it seems safe to say that finding a genuine connection is more reliant on the person than the medium where you meet the person. And let's be real: As much as we all want a romance novel meet cute, they just don't happen that often. At any rate, dating apps are a helpful step to mitigate the pressure of meeting someone new, especially for introverts or people generally looking to be a little more selective. The modern serendipity that is coming across your soulmate out of millions of profiles is more likely than you think: Two Stanford sociologists found that online dating is officially the most popular way for U.S. couples to connect. The 2017 survey found that 39 percent of heterosexual couples and 60 percent of same-sex couples originally met online, beating the numbers of older, traditional methods like meeting through friends or at work or school. Other recent studies about the types of connections being made deliver a swift blow to the antiquated arguments about online dating being solely rooted in superficial factors, like how hot someone's profile picture is: People who meet online are more likely to be compatible and, if they decide to tie the knot, have a higher chance of a healthy marriage \\u2014 that is, according to this study cited in the MIT Technology Review. More and more, we've seen that the trend of people looking for long-term commitments and prioritizing someone's emotional maturity over their physical attractiveness is here to stay, at least for the time being. Finally, people are realizing nothing is quite as sexy as honesty, open communication, and emotional availability. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Relationship icks, red flags, and the blurry line that separates them\\n            \\n\\n\\nOf course, meeting online doesn't guarantee that a couple won't break up or that everyone with a profile is trying to move at that pace. No one is assuming online dating is the variable that guarantees riding off into the sunset. But research does suggest that people who are willing to put effort and honesty into compatibility tests and open-ended profile questions might be more ready to get serious.The variety and quality of information on your profile mattersIn many cases, the amount of information you can get from these detailed profiles is more than what would be covered in the \"traditional\" period of getting to know someone. The whole \"do you want to have babies\" thing is a huge piece of information that could decide your future with someone, but it's very possible that such a weighty subject won't be brought up until you've caught feelings. However, many dating sites ask about kids \\u2014\\xa0whether you want them or already have them \\u2014\\xa0during the sign-up process (as well as other potentially-awkward questions), and probably won't match you with someone who has different goals than you do. Similarly, some of OkCupid's matching is rooted in political and social justice views. Will you find out if someone keeps guns in the house or opposes vaccinations on the first date? Probably not, but OkCupid sure as hell won't send you to get a beer with someone you'd start a fight with on Facebook. Now that we're over two years into the pandemic, most dating apps allow users to indicate on their profile that they're vaccinated, so you don't have to worry about finding out several dates in you've been hanging out with someone who has some pretty opposing ideological views from you. Plus, it's always nice when your current booty call doesn't suck as a person. Even if you're just in it for something frisky and fleeting, the personality you can gather from a simple bio or a few of Hinge's ice breakers might let you know who's worthy of your time \\u2014\\xa0even if that time is strictly within \"You up?\" hours.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Tinder is losing some momentum and Gen Z could be why\\n            \\n\\n\\nKnow that you have optionsJulie Spira, dating expert and CEO of cyberdatingexpert.com, says it wasn't always so easy to meet people online. She would know \\u2014\\xa0she's been helping clients find love online since 1994.\"People didn\\u2019t have mobile phones and laptops, and the process was people would go home, log on slowly, see who had written to them and write back,\" she says. \"The courtship process was a lot slower, so it took quite a while to get from the first interaction to actually going on a date. Plus in those days, there was a stigma associated with online dating. You did not tell people you met your spouse, or partner, or even a date online.\"The rhetoric has clearly come a long way since then, and the digital dating landscape has evolved with people's changing needs. OkCupid realized that the way a potential match votes matters romantically to a lot of people. Women were tired of men blowing up their messages with creepy first-liners, so Bumble came along. On Coffee Meets Bagel, only people you've liked back can message you, and swiping through people won't take up all your free time. \"Tindering\" is now a verb, but it's far from your only option.Online dating takes time and effortIf you're lucky, you'll find a perfect match right away, but that's not usually how it works out. While you do know more about online matches than you would a stranger you met in person, there's only so much a quick dating profile can tell you.Dating sites and apps can make finding a compatible potential partner easier, but it's still dating. Not everyone is going to be a gem. While apps like Bumble let you display what kind of relationship you're looking for, others don't, so you might end up going out with someone only to realize you're not looking for the same thing.That said, there will be people on dating sites who are looking for the same thing as you. And using a dating app to find them is a hell of a lot easier than going up to strangers on the street or in bars and asking if they're looking for a relationship. Apps and dating websites expand your dating pool and allow you to meet people with similar interests you might not run into naturally in your everyday life. You just might need a little patience to find The One. In the meantime, don't be afraid to tell your dates what you're looking for \\u2014 evaluating what you really want and being upfront with your intentions is kind of the name of the dating game these days.Dating apps may not be perfect, but many modern features facilitating more meaningful matches (or quicker, safer hookups) have sprung up even in the past five years.

Finding the right person for a casual hookup, however, isn't as easy as one would hope. With so many dating sites and hookup apps to choose from, it's hard to decipher which platform is the best option for a night of safe and shameless fun. To help you navigate the world of casual sex, we've rounded up the best hookup apps, plus some tips to help you get started. What is hookup culture?The term \"hookup culture\" refers to casual sex or uncommitted sexual encounters \\u2014 you know, good old-fashioned consensual sex just for the sake of it.  Dating apps and sites have certainly helped bring society firmly into its hookup culture era.\\xa0\"If having sex was once taboo, not having it is today,\" says Washington Post columnist Christine Emba in her book Rethinking Sex: A Provocation. Even though the pandemic has made more people intentional, honest, and serious when approaching dating, that doesn't mean long-term monogamous relationships are the only types of connections people want.In fact, being open to new experiences and casual connections was a trend of the past year, proving that people are still plenty interested in hooking up with hot strangers. Basically, there's nothing wrong with prioritizing looking for a hookup and, ultimately, your pleasure. Plus, bringing that intentionality to casual sex can help reduce any pressure you might feel about having or seeking out sex when you don't really, genuinely want it. And when you're on the same page as your partner, you reduce the risk of messy miscommunication.As for finding a similarly interested partner (or two), the dedicated hookup app is the horny person's vessel for hot instant gratification. But the cool thing is that most dating apps can be used for sex purposes these days. Where you decide to go to find your casual fling really just depends on how much you'd like to know about the person in your bed. The butterflies of meeting someone new are still there \\u2014 they just might be happening in a different region of the body.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            The best sex toys for masturbation that anybody can enjoy\\n            \\n\\n\\nThe online hookup atmosphere is full of horny anxious peopleAll things considered, it may seem like the ideal time for a mass release of all that pent-up sexual tension. But in reality, people are, of course, still nervous. Hinge actually coined the term Fear of Dating Again to encompass people's uneasiness to get back into the dating scene. Many feel like they have lost their game during isolation, and there's a hump that many online daters still need to get over. Time feels more valuable, and even those who are DTF may be more closely considering the authenticity and personality of prospects. If anything, surveys have found that this long period of isolation has made more people want to find a long-term partner.Still, this pandemic hasn't meant the death of hookup culture. Just like literally every other part of life, it's merely had to evolve and change with the times. Tinder and Hinge are still crawling with users, but baby steps between messaging for the first time and arranging a booty call may be the norm for now. The good news is that being upfront and honest about what you're looking for has become more of the norm over the past two years, so people are more likely to appreciate you coming right out and saying you want something light and fun. Plenty of apps have also built-in the \"what you're looking for\" question into profile preferences, making it a much easier topic to broach. Are dating sites safe?The pandemic brought on a whole new meaning to having safe sex with strangers. Some dating apps have added vaccination status as a section to their profiles, so you can tell if someone's going to be a safer hookup or not without having to waste time chatting with someone you won't feel comfortable seeing IRL. Badge or not, if you have any hesitations being direct and asking people outright about their vaccination status and what they're comfortable with is a good way to make an informed decision. \\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to have the best shower sex\\n            \\n\\n\\nTaking precautions doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself. Over the past couple of years, people have been learning how to be safe while exploring new desires and kinks.  On a more general dating app note, looking out for profile verification is another way to make sure you're meeting up with a real person who's who they say they are. Tinder, OkCupid, and HER are some of the apps on this list that make it clear what users have verified profiles. What makes a good hookup app?A good hookup doesn't have to be a one-and-done situation. Sure, things can be kept as anonymous as taking a nameless person home from the bar, but there's also nothing wrong with ensuring that the person getting to see you naked doesn't have the world's worst sense of humor. Plus, getting along well with a hookup, even if you're not looking for anything serious or exclusive, can help if you are looking for a regular friends-with-benefits situation. Though many of these apps make it obvious that people are looking for *that,* people on more generalized dating apps can avoid a lot of messiness if a head's up about intentions is given within the first few DMs. Many apps even include an option to mark what you're looking for, so your intentions can be clear from the get-go without any messages.You'll probably also want to skip any apps that feature a 10-minute questionnaire about romance and future families or ones that require expensive subscriptions intended for people who want long-term relationships. However, you should choose an app that has ample space to showcase what you're looking for \\u2014 and maybe turn a few people on with your personality. Photos are also a huge factor in good hookup apps. Some apps and dating sites hide people's pics unless you have a paid subscription, and we don't really love that \\u2014 for physical attraction reasons and safety reasons. Apps that show the full view of someone's profile are the way to go.Whether you want to pay for a hookup app or not is totally up to you, but we will say Tinder and Hinge have great free versions of the app. You can likely find a hookup by the weekend without paying a cent.Whether you're looking for casual sex or are simply looking to exchange nudes, here are our picks for the best hookup apps right now:", "link": "https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps", "pubDate": "Mon, 10 Apr 2023 15:34:31 +0000"}, {"title": "Grab a new Nespresso machine on sale at Amazon right now", "description": "As of April 10, several Nespresso machines are on sale at Amazon for up to 30% off.

Danny and Amy's feud begins as a boxing match, then plateaus as a strategic chess game with the two carefully planning their acts of revenge. But by Beef's finale, the show throws them back in the ring in a free-for-all in which everyone they know is a player, and no rules apply.\\xa0Beef's last two episodes feel like they're injected with Gatorade, as Danny and Amy's feud reaches new, completely unexpected heights. There's an accidental kidnapping, a failed heist, a cop shootout, a poisonous berry-induced hallucinatory trip, and a final shot that sees Danny and Amy holding each other on a hospital bed. Boiled down, Beef is an enemies-to-lovers pipeline, but to really understand the show's ending, we need to understand its beginning \\u2014 the real reason Danny and Amy's feud started, and how they knew they needed each other from the start.\\xa0Why did Danny and Amy's feud even begin?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Netflix\\n\\n\\nRight off the bat, we quickly learn that Danny and Amy hate their lives. On the day of their road rage incident, Danny is on the verge of attempting suicide, exhausted by a relay race of disappointment and life never working out the way he'd hoped. Amy, in the middle of a grueling business deal, is tired of constantly bearing the weight of her family on her shoulders and just wants to catch a break. It's immediately apparent that no one in their lives is actually there to listen to them, and when they do, they just give a bunch of unsolicited advice.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAli Wong and Steven Yeun on why revenge is a universal touchpoint in \\u2018Beef\\u2019\\n\\n\\n\\nDanny and Amy need someone to listen to them be angry. And not just scream-in-your-pillow angry, but full-body venting. When Amy tries to vent to her husband, George (Joseph Lee), he waxes lyrical on anger being a transitory emotion and suggests she practice gratitude instead. I hate to say it, but sometimes we don't need to meditate, we need to scream, and that's OK! Danny and Amy's road rage was a way to let out all the emotions they were feeling that day.As it went on, it was as if Danny and Amy had signed an agreement to be each other's stress balls, because nothing in their lives promised that same relief. That mutual recognition was the first ground of empathy between them, and while they weren't ready to admit it initially, by the show's finale we see Danny and Amy finally understand how much they've relied on each other all along.\\xa0What really happened in Beef's finale?\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: Netflix\\n\\n\\nWith Danny and Amy's feud going from playground to personal, aka, from peeing on each other's carpets to abusing family trauma for blackmail, they started learning the most intimate details about each other. As an audience, it was apparent in these moments that Danny and Amy were two sides of the same coin. They were going through the same issues and emotions, and needed the same thing \\u2014 someone to listen to them. If they just let their anger subside and let themselves realize all the similarities stringing through the trauma they were using against each other, they'd finally realize they were the answer they both needed.

And talk they do.

In their conversation, they found each other as companions \\u2014 two people willing to actually see each other for who they are. Danny and Amy were always right for each other. It just took 48 hours of stranded delirium to finally get them to accept it.\\xa0They initially found each other as partners in anger, two buddies always up for a brawl. By the finale, they'd found each other as partners, period, two people who understand each other more than anyone else in their lives. Their mutual stress ball turned into a hug. And while Beef's final shot of Danny holding Amy in his sleep might be surprising for some, it was there all along.\\xa0If you rewatch Beef with the knowledge of its ending, you'll realize that it's all really about two soulmates finding each other.

The founder and CEO of Waystar Royco passed away on a flight to meet with GoJo CEO Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsg\\xe5rd), which he chose to prioritize over the wedding of his eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck). A Rupert Murdoch-meets-King Lear type, Logan was a titan of media, a ferocious businessman, and creator of beloved game Boar on the Floor. But while he died a billionaire, he would be the first to remind you that he came from humble beginnings.Born in 1938 in Dundee, Scotland \\u2014 the \"North Bank\" as son Kendall (Jeremy Strong) described in his infamous rap, \"L to the OG\" \\u2014 Logan Roy built media conglomerate Waystar Royco from the ground up. The company is known for its flagship network ATN, which is known in turn for employing controversial anchors like Mark Ravenhead (Zack Robidas), who may or may not be a Nazi. (Signs like reading Mein Kampf multiple times point to \"probably a Nazi.\") Waystar's cruises division was also the subject of Succession scandal, as the surfacing of sexual assault allegations led to employees of Waystar Royco testifying before Congress.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Logan Roy is dead. Here's how \"Succession\" handled it.\\n            \\n\\n\\nA friend of many high-profile figures, including presidents, Logan weathered several such scandals throughout his time as CEO. He also survived multiple attempts to take over Waystar, including one brought about by his Number One Boy, Kendall. To say Kendall and Logan's relationship was \"complicated\" would be an understatement. Logan blackmailed Kendall over his manslaughter, then attempted to use Kendall as a sacrificial fall guy for Waystar's wrongdoings. In turn, Kendall exposed his father in the subsequent press conference, calling him \"a malignant presence, a bully, and a liar.\" (This was not long after the aforementioned rap, in which Kendall said, \"Since I stan Dad, I'm alive and well.\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrian Cox in \"Succession.\"\\nCredit: Peter Kramer/HBO\\n\\n\\nTheir father-son connection was just one of many of Logan's tumultuous personal relationships, such as his strained separation from his older brother Ewan (James Cromwell) and his three failed marriages. The first two ended in divorce, while the third, to Marcia (Hiam Abbass), was deeply fractured by the time of Logan's death. Cheating on your wife with former PGM CEO Rhea Jarrell (Holly Hunter) and your current self-described \"friend, assistant, and advisor\" Kerry Castellabate (Zoe Winters) will do that!But those relationships are just tiny spills compared to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch of mess that was how Logan treated his children Connor, Kendall, Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin). Logan's many showdowns with Kendall made that relationship the most public, but he was withholding and abusive towards all his kids. He pitted them against each other for control of Waystar, neglected them when they did not interest him, and could always be counted on to call them \"sicko\" or some choice homophobic slur. At the Argestes retreat, Logan even slapped Roman. Himself a victim of abuse at the hands of his Uncle Noah, Logan continued that vicious cycle right to the end of his life.Whatever love Logan failed to show his kids, he showed to his business. Even as he sold Waystar to GoJo, he demanded to remain in control of ATN. In the days before the deal was set to go through, he moseyed terrifyingly around the ATN newsroom like a hitman Santa Clause before delivering a rousing speech about destroying the competition. \"This is not the end,\" he told his fired-up employees as they cheered his name. But the world had other plans for him.The loss of Logan Roy \\u2014 and Brian Cox's brilliantly blustery performance \\u2014 will no doubt leave a gaping hole in our Sunday night viewing, just as it will leave a hole in the hearts of his children and a vacancy at the very top of Waystar's corporate ladder. But before we turn to wondering about who will succeed the late Logan, join me in wishing the OG himself farewell with his two favorite words.

There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need. What is Quordle?Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.Is Quordle harder than Wordle?Yes, though not diabolically so.Where did Quordle come from?Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle \\u2014 the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.\\xa0How is Quordle pronounced?\\u201cKwordle.\\u201d It should rhyme with \\u201cWordle,\\u201d and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like \"curdle.\\u201dIs Quordle strategy different from Wordle?Yes and no.Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there\\u2019s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.After your first guess, however, you\\u2019ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.What should I do in Quordle that I don\\u2019t do in Wordle?Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to \\u201c-IGHT,\\u201d you could guess \\u201cMIGHT\\u201d \\u201cNIGHT\\u201d \\u201cLIGHT\\u201d and \\u201cSIGHT\\u201d and one of those will probably be the solution \\u2014 though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on \\u201chard mode.\\u201d In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.\\xa0Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven\\u2019t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.Is there a way to get the answer faster?In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don\\u2019t care about having the fewest possible guesses:Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: \\u201cNOTES,\\u201d \\u201cACRID,\\u201d and \\u201cLUMPY.\\u201d YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: \\u201cCANOE,\\u201d \\u201cSKIRT,\\u201d \\u201cPLUMB,\\u201d and \\u201cFUDGY.\\u201dMost of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you\\u2019ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you\\u2019ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:Are there any double or triple letters in today\\u2019s Quordle words?One word has a double letter.Are any rare letters being used in today\\u2019s Quordle like Q or Z?No.What do today\\u2019s Quordle words start with?T, C, S, and H.What are the answers for today\\u2019s Quordle?Are you sure you want to know?There\\u2019s still time to turn back.OK, you asked for it.

You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if you're after more of a challenge, though.Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?Though usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day, occasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers acceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it acquired the puzzle game.The Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen even less frequently than before.

Have you recovered from the emotional rollercoaster that was Succession Season 4, episode 3, \"Connor's Wedding\"? This episode saw Connor (Alan Ruck) and Willa (Justine Lupe) tie the knot, but in an even more shocking turn of events, it also marked the death of Logan Roy (Brian Cox).There's no doubt that Logan's death is Succession's most shocking development so far. It's a sudden offing of one of the show's most prominent characters, coming just three episodes into the season. Who could have seen this coming?\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Logan Roy is dead. Here's how 'Succession' handled it.\\n            \\n\\n\\nApparently, anyone who looked closely at the Succession Season 4 poster! Sarah Snook, who plays Shiv, confirmed in an interview with Jimmy Fallon that the poster hides a clue. \"You won't know until you know,\" she said. \"There is a thing that once the season begins airing, it may get related back to this moment.\"The poster depicts the Roy family standing on a skyscraper balcony overlooking the New York City skyline. However, the hint is not lurking in the crowd of brooding Roys. Instead, it lies in wait towards the reflection at the top of a poster: a lone plane, flying through the clouds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's as plain as the plane on the poster's face.\\nCredit: Courtesy of HBO\\n\\n\\nAviation has always played a large role in Succession. The Roys are constantly jetting off to who-knows-where \\u2014 and you know they aren't flying commercial. Succession often uses flight as a power play too, such as when Logan blocks his children from departing in a company helicopter in Season 4, episode 2. However, air travel is about to take on a whole new meaning in the context of Succession, as Logan collapses and passes away mid-flight on his way to meet up with Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsg\\xe5rd).A plane en route to discuss an acquisition deal might just be the most Logan Roy place to die. The man is incapable of turning his business brain off, even on his eldest son's wedding day. Plus, thousands of feet in the air, he's completely isolated from any of his family. It's a physical representation of his emotional distance from his own children.The plane on the Season 4 poster obviously can't hint at all of that, but it did hide where Logan would die right under our noses.

This pivotal episode may be titled \"Connor's Wedding,\" but it's really going to go down in TV history as \"The One Where Logan Dies.\" That's right: Logan Roy (Brian Cox), patriarch of the Roy family, founder and CEO of Waystar Royco, L to the OG himself, is dead and gone. Logan's death is Succession's biggest narrative swing yet, bigger than any business deal or betrayal. If Succession is a game of chess, this twist is the equivalent of removing the king from the board. Scratch that; it's the equivalent of throwing the board on the floor and leaving the other pieces to flounder in emotional (and likely financial) distress.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Remembering Logan Roy: An obituary for 'Succession's CEO and family man\\n            \\n\\n\\nWhile the ramifications of Logan's passing will be major \\u2014 who will succeed him as CEO? \\u2014 the most fascinating aspect of his death remains Succession's daring handling of it. There is no grand finale for Logan. In fact, Succession separates the audience from Logan's death as much as possible. We never see him collapse on his flight to meet with Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsg\\xe5rd), nor do we get a clear shot of his body. Instead, we experience Logan's death as his children do: from far, far away. It's Succession's way of telling us that the moment of Logan's death doesn't matter. What really matters is his children's reactions.When it comes to Logan's death, distance is everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeremy Strong and Sarah Snook in \"Succession.\"\\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\\n\\n\\nNone of Logan's children are with him when he dies: They're all at Connor's wedding, something Logan skipped to speak to Matsson. Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook), and Roman (Kieran Culkin) get a call from Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) onboard Logan's plane. He informs them of Logan's collapse and lets them speak their last words to him through his phone. The sequence is eerily reminiscent of Season 4's very first episode, which saw Tom act as a proxy between the Roy children and their own father as they entered a bidding war over Pierce Media.Tom's role as go-between is just one of several ways in which Succession distances the Roy children, and by extension the audience, from Logan's death. Just like we never see Logan fall, we also never get a clear glimpse of his body. We spend most of our time watching Kendall, Shiv, and Roman worry through the phone, unable to do anything for their father except react in the moment.\\n\\n\\nFeatured Video For You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeremy Strong on how he approached is roles for 'Succession' and 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccession heightens these reactions further by emphasizing the physical space between Logan and his children. Emotionally, these characters are far apart even when they're in the same room, but after the Roy kids' sound rejection of Logan's attempted karaoke apology, that emotional distance has never been greater. Succession reflects that in its location choices. The kids are at sea, on a boat to Connor's wedding, while a dying Logan is thousands of feet in the air.Logan's death is Succession at its most stressful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKieran Culkin in \"Succession.\"\\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\\n\\n\\nThe fact that both parties are in transit only adds to the tension of the episode. \"Connor's Wedding\" is an excruciatingly stressful hour that sees uncertainty gradually morph into shocked acceptance. From their place on a boat \\u2014 to a wedding, no less \\u2014 Kendall, Shiv, and Roman have absolutely no control over the situation. All they can do is sit, and talk, and try to keep the news of Logan's death from leaking to the press. Since we spend most of the episode squarely in their point of view, we feel just as powerless as they do.Distance isn't the only trick Succession has in its playbook to make us feel the enormity of this moment. As the Roys speak to their father and process the possibility of his death, the show strips back Nicholas Britell's score \\u2014 barely any music accompanies these key scenes. On top of that, continuous shots trained on the Roy siblings keep us firmly in their point of view, while the juxtaposition of the wedding celebration and Logan's death only serves to heighten the horror of the situation. It also calls to mind a pivotal moment from Season 1, when Kendall returns to Shiv and Tom's wedding after leaving a waiter for dead and has to act like his world isn't completely falling apart.One major difference between Kendall's wedding manslaughter and Logan's wedding death? The former is a finale event, while the latter occurs in the third episode of a season. Those kinds of major character turning points, especially a death, are the kinds of moments we've come to expect from late-in-the-season episodes and finales. That Logan's death comes so early and that it comes before the deal with Matsson goes through are no doubt shocking. \"Surely they can't kill him now,\" I kept telling myself throughout the episode. Yet kill him they did \\u2014 and when you watch back through Season 4, you see just how inevitable it was.\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            How to watch the drama unfold on 'Succession' Season 4\\n            \\n\\n\\nLogan's death is a total surprise \\u2014 and also completely inevitable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrian Cox in \"Succession.\"\\nCredit: David Russell/HBO\\n\\n\\nOn the one hand, Logan's death is a wild shock to Succession's system. Just last episode he delivered a bloodthirsty speech to his ATN staff from atop a stack of printer paper in a Rupert Murdoch-inspired moment. In the speech, he waxed poetic about cutting his opposition's throats before proclaiming, \"This is not the end.\" One episode later, we're hit with the opposite. Even after all of Logan's big talk while boarding his plane, it is, in fact, the end.Succession has certainly hinted at this throughout the season, especially in its first episode. In a parallel to Season 1, Season 4 opens with Logan's birthday \\u2014 a reminder of his deteriorated relationship with his family and, naturally, his own aging. He even contemplates mortality with his bodyguard Colin (Paul Nielsen), wondering about what comes after life. In true Logan Roy fashion, he thinks the answer is nothing.The parallel to Succession's first-ever episode also recalls the near-fatal stroke Logan has at his 80th birthday party in Season 1 \\u2014 something he survives, along with countless attempts to wrest Waystar Royco from his control. After all, Succession has always made the point that Logan is an unkillable man. Yet the reminder of that first stroke is enough to make you realize that Logan is a goner as soon as Tom reveals Logan's critical situation. Succession wouldn't pull the same near-death storyline with Logan twice, especially not as the show approaches its endgame. Of course, the Roy siblings wouldn't be thinking like that, so we're left to sit with them in limbo as they wait for confirmation of their father's passing.To show Logan's death or not to show Logan's death, that is the question...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrian Cox in \"Succession.\"\\nCredit: Macall B. Polay/HBO\\n\\n\\nThe only move more daring than killing Logan so early in the season is killing him offscreen. It's a choice that is sure to be polarizing. People who hate Logan might wish they'd seen him flounder in his final moments, while people who love him might have wanted a chance to say one last farewell. In keeping with the episode's throughline of distance, Succession gives neither party the satisfaction. Logan haters and fans may have different interpretations of the exclusion of Logan's death. Is it a slight or a sign of respect to this character whom the show has built up as a tyrannical titan of media? A more likely answer: This is simply how Succession operates.Throughout its run, Succession has made a pattern of not showing key events to the audience. We don't see Shiv's initial confrontation with Tom about his actions in the Season 3 finale, nor do we see the Roy siblings coming up with The Hundred. These omissions are a sign of Succession's confidence in itself \\u2014 it knows the audience can infer characters' shared histories given a few well-placed lines. However, it's also proof that Succession knows when to show exactly what matters. We don't need to see Logan die, we just need to know it occurred in order to understand the behavior of everyone caught in his orbit. The aftermath of Logan's passing is what Succession is truly interested in, which is why we still have most of Season 4 to go. How it happened is secondary. Succession is now streaming on HBO Max, with new episodes airing at 9 p.m. ET Sundays on HBO and HBO Max.

The official Twitter account for National Public Radio (or NPR) controversially got a \"U.S. state-affiliated media\" label on its profile last week, which was quietly changed to \"government-funded media\" over the weekend, per Gizmodo.

Strangely enough, the new label is actually less broad and thus potentially less accurate. Direct government funding only accounts for about one percent of the outlet's annual budget, per NPR itself.

Quite the opposite, possibly. Rather than ripping stars to shreds and swallowing up every morsel, this black hole is believed to be fostering new star formation, leaving a trail of newborn stars stretching 200,000 light-years through space. Pieter van Dokkum, an astronomy professor at Yale University, said as the black hole rams into gas, it seems to trigger a narrow corridor of new stars, where the gas has a chance to cool. How exactly it works, though, isn't known, said van Dokkum, who led research on the phenomenon captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope accidentally. A paper on the findings was published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\\u201cWhat we\\u2019re seeing is the aftermath,\" he said in a statement. \"Like the wake behind a ship, we\\u2019re seeing the wake behind the black hole.\\u201d\\nSEE ALSO:\\n\\n            Black holes, ranked\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Tweet may have been deleted\\n        (opens in a new tab)\\n\\n\\nBlack holes are some of the most elusive things in outer space. The most common kind, a stellar black hole, is often thought to be the result of an enormous star dying in a supernova explosion. The star's material then collapses onto itself, condensing into a relatively tiny area.But how supermassive black holes, millions to billions of times more massive than the sun, form is even more mysterious. Many astrophysicists and cosmologists believe these behemoths lurk at the center of virtually all galaxies. Recent Hubble Space Telescope observations have bolstered the theory that supermassive black holes get their start in the dusty cores of starburst galaxies, where new stars are rapidly churned out, but scientists are still trying to get to the bottom of it.Want more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox?

Instead, they have a boundary called an \"event horizon\"\\u2014it's a point of no return. Generally, if anything swoops too close, it will fall in, never to escape the hole's gravitational pull.

One could have been stealing momentum from the other two and gotten ejected out of its host galaxy, while the other two shot off in the other direction. Evidence that might support this idea is that there is no sign of an active black hole remaining at the galaxy's core. Van Dokkum was looking for star clusters in a nearby galaxy when he noticed what appeared to be a little streak in his Hubble image. At first, he thought it was a cosmic ray causing an artifact in the photo. After further analysis at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, he and his team predicted it must be a train of young blue stars. The trail is almost half as bright as the host galaxy, indicating it is a hotbed of stellar action. The scientists plan to confirm the black hole explanation with follow-up observations using the James Webb Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.", "link": "https://mashable.com/article/runaway-black-hole-hubble-discovery", "pubDate": "Sun, 09 Apr 2023 20:02:24 +0000"}, {"title": "'Star Wars Jedi: Survivor' gets an exciting final trailer", "description": "As if there wasn't enough cool-looking Star Wars stuff coming down the pike, the sequel to one of the best Star Wars video games is almost here.
